"The Week In Cannabis: 4/20, SAFE Banking Act, The NFL, Verano And Much More In the week of 4/20, the unofficial day of cannabis and top sales day for the industry, major stocks posted mixed performances.
Retailer Planet 13 Holdings Inc. (CSE: PLTH) (OTCQB: PLNHF) reported single-day record sales of $543,000 on April 20. Meanwhile, Eaze, California's largest marketplace for legal cannabis delivery, announced a 185% surge in deliveries (compared to any other Tuesday in 2021), with an average basket of $200, up 50% from the same day in 2020.
“Cannabis consumers moved to delivery as their preferred way of shopping last year, so we're not surprised to see such a strong 420 in 2021,” said Ro Choy, CEO of Eaze. “Even as daily life begins to return to normal, consumers are staying with the convenience of delivery. It's the future of this industry.”
Debra Borchardt, CEO of Green Market Report, added, “The April 20 holiday is becoming the largest sales day of the year for the industry. Headset reported logging $60,000 in sales per minute, while Planet 13 said it did over half a million sales on Tuesday. Even Ayr Wellness clocked in an amazing $1.2 million day across its stores. One can only imagine what these numbers will look like next year with New Jersey and New York celebrating.”

The U.S. House of Representatives approved the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act in a vote of 321-101. The bill would allow cannabis companies to obtain much-needed banking services, as a majority are now working with large amounts of cash.
The National Football League announced its new drug policy, which excludes cannabis testing during the offseason.

Policy, Science And Data
With the growing number of medical cannabis patients in Ohio, the state decided to more than double the number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the following year, enabling companies to apply for 73 new dispensary licenses this summer, bringing the total to 130 across the state.
The mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, Randall Woodfin confirmed that blanket pardons for some 15,0000 cannabis convictions going back more than 30 years will be issued.
The Denver City Council voted in favor of a bill to enable cannabis product delivery and cannabis lounges.
Lawmakers in North Carolina introduced a bill poised to legalize cannabis possession for adults.
Florida's push for adult-use cannabis legalization saw a substantial setback Thursday morning.
In a 5-2 decision, state Supreme Court justices ruled that advocacy group Make It Legal Florida's signature drive was invalid after its ballot summary was deemed misleading and unconstitutional.
A study by the data company YouGov and Sunnyside, a dispensary brand owned by Cresco Labs (OTCQX:CRLBF), revealed that one in four Americans used cannabis during the pandemic last year. The number of existing cannabis consumers has increased 56% in two years.
According to new data from consumer insights firm MRI-Simmons, 26% of cannabis consumers in the U.S. are aged 50+. This segment, aptly named “CannaBoomers”, is made up of nearly 17 million Americans who said they consume cannabis for physical and mental health benefits. 
“The appeal of cannabis is broad and growing,” Karen Ramspacher, MRI’s senior vice president of innovation and insights, told Benzinga. “When we think cannabis consumers, we think young and hip. While this is true, there is an over-50 segment that has more buying power than their younger counterparts and have a clear interest in a wide array of current and new cannabis products.

"Here's Why Stock Valuations Are Still 'Quite Reasonable' The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) is now up roughly 90% from its March 2020 lows in just 13 months.
A number of traditional valuation metrics are now indicating stocks are extremely overvalued relative to historical norms, but LPL Financial analyst Jeffrey Buchbinder said Monday there’s an excellent case to be made that stock prices are actually right where they belong.
Key Factors: In a blog post, Buchbinder said the S&P 500 is currently trading at about 22 times consensus forward earnings, significantly above its long-term average of about 17. The S&P 500’s Shiller PE Ratio, a longer-term valuation metric that accounts for 10 years of earnings data, is currently sitting at 37.6, more than double its long-term average of 16.8.
However, Buchbinder said investors shouldn’t get spooked by these valuation metrics for several reasons.

"The Week In Cannabis: PA, MD, Big Tobacco, GTI, Sundial, MedMen, Earnings, Financings And More Cannabis stocks traded mostly in the green this week, as we got into earnings season.
“While there were a lot of companies reporting earnings, like Turning Point Brands who gave guidance of $422 million for 2021, I thought the biggest piece of data came from Pennsylvania,” Debra Borchardt, editor-in-chief of Green Market Report, told Benzinga. “The state reported that in one year it had sold over $900 million in medical marijuana. This demonstrates the demand for cannabis in this state and bodes well for any future adult-use legalization. This is also a big number when one considers that the program has only just gotten underway.”
And, while Pennsylvania sales surpassed $900 million in one year, Maryland sales finally hit $1 billion, more than three years after the medical cannabis program launched in December of 2017.
Meanwhile, the Swiss-American multinational Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE: PM), maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said it's considering getting into the cannabis industry. The company is currently analyzing key components of the industry, such as the “toxicity of cannabis, efficacy and differences between pharmaceutical and consumer options.”
CEO Andre Calantzopoulos reportedly said, “We are doing all this work and will determine one day what avenues to pursue… But our priority is what we’re doing with our smoke-free products, and that’s where I would stay on cannabis.”
Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo. 
This is not the first foray of big tobacco into the cannabis industry. In 2018, Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) invested CA$2.4 billion ($1.8 billion) in Cronos Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRON), and only last month, British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE: BTI) confirmed a CA$221-million investment in OrganiGram Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: OGI)
ETFs posted mostly positive performances. Over the five trading days of this week:

The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ): gained 1%.
The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO): advanced 2.8%.
The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (NYSE: MSOS): rose 6.7%.
The Cannabis ETF (NYSE: THCX): was up 1.8%.
The Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (NYSE: CNBS): was down 0.37%.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) closed the week almost flat.

On the policy front, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill to study the various impacts of state-legalized cannabis programs. The bill would assess both medical and recreational cannabis programs and their economic, public health, criminal justice and workplace effects.
The study would also look at revenue streams generated by legal marijuana markets, how the revenue is used and how it impacts state budgets.  
Aside from financial metrics, the study would look at consumption among population groups, medicinal usage and the impact of cannabis on the opioid crisis.
Policy, Science And Data
According to a recent report from the Brightfield Group, the U.S. cannabis market is set to reach $30.6 billion by 2025.
In Florida, two businesses looking to open medical cannabis dispensaries in downtown Miami have filed lawsuits against the city, which has refused to authorize dispensary openings, despite the fact that the state legalized medical cannabis in 2016 by way of a constitutional amendment that was passed with a 71% approval rate.
Texas continues to ease restrictions for its medical cannabis program. This week, several cannabis-related measures were approved in the House, including a proposal to research the potential of psychedelics such as psilocybin and MDMA and to expand the state’s medical cannabis program by adding more qualifying conditions to the list.
Under this bill, the Department of State Health Services would add cancer, chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to its list of qualifying conditions. It could also raise the THC cap for medical cannabis products from 0.5% to 5%.

"Why Stocks Could Be 'Dead Money' For The Next Few Months It’s once again that time of year when investors start bringing up the old Wall Street adage “sell in May and go away.”
Historically, the S&P 500 has generated its weakest returns from May to November. In fact, going back to 1950, the six-month stretch from the beginning of May through the end of October has generated an average return of just 1.5%, making it the weakest six-month stretch of the year.
Reasons For Caution: This year, the S&P 500 started off the month of May with a gain, but Hilary Kramer, chief investment officer for Kramer Capital Research, said Monday there are plenty of reasons for investors to be cautious on the stock market in the near-term.

On Monday, Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ: TLRY) and Aphria, Inc. (NASDAQ: APHA) closed their merger after months of negotiations, creating a company with a combined market cap of $3.3 billion. Benzinga spoke with Irwin Simon, CEO of the new combined company.
Check out the video below:

Following the merger, Jefferies upgraded the rating for Tilray from Underperform to Buy, while raising the price target from $4.77 to $23.
Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) finalized its acquisition of GW Pharmaceuticals plc. (NASDAQ: GWPH), the producer of the FDA‑approved prescription cannabidiol drug Epidiolex, for $7.2 billion or $6.7 billion net of GW Pharma's cash.
Meanwhile, Ascend Wellness Holdings (CSE: AAWH) started trading on the Canadian Securities exchange following a raise of approximately $80 million through an initial public offering of roughly 10 million shares of its Class A common stock at $8 per share.
Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo. 
After two weeks of consolidating below resistance at the $1 level, shares of Reddit favorite Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ: SNDL) have resumed their downtrend.
Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE: CS) reportedly stopped handling transactions in shares of cannabis companies with U.S. operations and plans to refrain from holding cannabis stocks on behalf of its clients.
The Swiss-based lender, which declined to give a statement, was among a handful of banks willing to buy and sell marijuana-related stocks and hold the shares as a custodian for clients in the United States. While it's not yet clear what impact this decision will have, Reuters reported the move has affected the sale of marijuana stocks in recent weeks.
In fact, all major ETFs were down. Over the five trading days of this week:

The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ): lost 0.2%.
The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO): tumbled 1.8%.
The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (NYSE: MSOS): shed 0.2% of its value.
The Cannabis ETF (NYSE: THCX): dropped 3.4%.
The Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (NYSE: CNBS): was down 3.5%.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) closed the week up 1.21%.

Policy, Science And Data
In New York, people gathered to celebrate cannabis legalization.
“Last weekend's annual New York City cannabis parade brought out a who's who in politicians jockeying for position to be the one who was always supportive of legalizing cannabis. Ah-hem. Water under the bridge shall we say,” commented Debra Borchardt, CEO of Green Market Report. “With adult use cannabis sales likely to be legal by next year's parade, the people who attended were clearly in a celebratory mood. The New York market is expected to be the largest in the country and there were many small businesses working the crowd. There should be a Tinder app for social equity applicants to hook up with investors as there was a lot of talk about social equity applicants, but most have no money or very little.”
In Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill that would expand access to medical cannabis for school children in need by removing obstacles to its administration.
Financings And M&A
Jushi Holdings Inc. (CSE: JUSH) (OTC: JUSHF) finalized its purchase of a 93,000 sq. ft. facility operated by its subsidiary, Dalitso LLC, for around $22 million. The deal also includes nearly nine acres of surrounding land in Prince William County, Virginia.

"Where Is The SPY Headed Next? Options Traders Aren't So Sure Right Now SPDR S&P500 (ARCA: SPY) pulled back Tuesday after reaching a new all-time high Friday and maintaining it on Monday.

"'I'm Playing A Bit Of Defense': Experts React To 4.2% CPI Inflation The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) traded lower by 1.7% on Wednesday after the U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 4.2% in the month of April, its largest increase since September 2008.
April’s inflation increase exceeded consensus economist estimates of 3.6%.
Fed Not Alarmed: Federal Reserve vice chairman Richard Clarida said investors should expect inflation numbers to temporarily rise further in coming months as the U.S. recovers from the pandemic. However, Clarida said inflation should moderate in the second half of 2021.
“These one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on underlying inflation, and I expect inflation to return to—or perhaps run somewhat above—our 2% longer-run goal in 2022 and 2023,” Clarida said.
The headline inflation number certainly seemed to spook investors, who are concerned the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected to cool down an overheated economy.

"The Week In Cannabis: Trulieve's $2.1B Acquisition, New ETF, Earnings, Federal Legalization And More In a week of big M&A news and mixed earnings reports, cannabis stocks traded mostly down.
On Monday, Trulieve Cannabis Corp. (CSE: TRUL) (OTCQX: TCNNF) announced it's purchasing Harvest Health & Recreation Inc. (CSE: HARV) (OTCQX: HRVSF) for roughly $2.1 billion in stock. Harvest shareholders will own roughly 26.7% of Trulieve's issued and outstanding pro forma shares on a fully diluted basis.
Commenting on the deal, Debra Borchardt, CEO of Green Market Report, told Benzinga, “The acquisition is likely to come with its fair share of headaches. Harvest Health has a mountain of debt and lots of lawsuits over various deals. Still Trulieve is certainly on a quest to become a nationwide company and this will certainly help pave the way.”
Cantor Fitzgerald’s Pablo Zuanic kept an Overweight rating on Trulieve’s stock but lowered the price target to $76 from $89. Changes to the price target were necessary in response to the new merger and increased share count to 181 million, explained Zaunic.
On Thursday, Trulieve reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. The Tallahassee, Florida-based company revealed it generated record quarterly revenue of $193.8 million over the period, representing sequential and year-over-year growth of 15% and 102%, respectively.
The Boston Beer Company Inc (NYSE: SAM) is creating a Canada-based subsidiary focusing on research and development of non-alcoholic  cannabis beverages. While current federal U.S. law prohibits the commercial sale of cannabis products, the company believes this could change in the near future.
Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo. 
ETF Manager Group (ETMG), the issuer behind the wildly successful ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ), launched its new ETFMG US Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJUS), focused on U.S. cannabis companies.
Curaleaf Holdings (OTC: CURLF) posted its first-quarter 2021 financial results with total revenue of $260.32 million, up by 170% from the same period of 2020. The company reported a positive adjusted EBITDA of $62.63 million, which compares to $20 million in the same quarter of the prior year.
Following the earnings report, the closing of its EMMAC acquisition and an $80 million financing, Cantor's Zuanic reiterated an Overweight rating on Curaleaf’s stock and kept his 12-month price target of $26.50, stating the company seems on track to hitting its fiscal year 2021 sales guidance of $1.2 to $1.3 billion.
Also this week, Curaleaf International's subsidiary, Adven GmbH, introduced its medical cannabis products in Germany.
ETFs were all in the red. Over the five trading days of this week:

On Tuesday the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) lost a key level at the $412 mark. Along with a continued fear of inflation, two imminent factors are contributing to the choppiness:

Monthly vix expiry on Wednesday.
Monthly options expiry on Friday.

The above factors are creating increased volatility and some bearish pressure as institutions are selling options contracts and deciding whether to — or how to — roll them out into future dates. This often increases trading volume.

Up until now, one cultivator - a farm functioning as part of the University of Mississippi - was the only legal source of cannabis for federal research. The university had obtained the license back in 1968, which made it the only source for research cannabis in the United States for over 50 years.
The Mississippi Supreme Court on Friday overturned (on a technicality) the state's voter-approved medical cannabis initiative in a six to three vote.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill doubling the marijuana possession limit for adults 21 and older to up to two ounces.
In addition to increasing the cannabis possession limit, House Bill 1090, which was cleared in a Senate vote in late April, seeks to identify people with prior convictions for up to 2 ounces of pot possession and clear their records.

The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest.

"The Week In Cannabis: Stocks Trade Up On Federal Bill (MORE Act), Earnings, Big M&A Cannabis stocks traded up this week, aided by strong earnings reports, big M&A announcements and the reintroduction of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE) into Congress, after the previous year's version failed to pass the Senate.
The MORE Act would remove marijuana from the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) while addressing resentencing for cannabis offenses and preventing federal agencies from prohibiting security clearance or benefits because of cannabis use.
If passed, the bill would also provide extended Small Business Administration (SBA) aid for those affected by the War on Drugs.
The MORE Act comes with the backing of over 150 organizations across the country, including the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA).
The Senate is preparing its own reform bill.

Policy, Science And Data
During a Wednesday Senate budget hearing, Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) shared positive remarks about the therapeutic potential of psychedelics such as psilocybin and MDMA, as well as about the progress being made in access to medical marijuana for federal research.
“We’re making some progress. You may know that in the past, researchers who wanted to do clinical studies on marijuana had all kinds of limitations,"" Collins said, adding that for the past five decades there had been only one source of marijuana for federal research purposes.
“That of course is an issue because it’s a limited opportunity for access.”
The Brightfield Group released a report on the U.S. CBD market, speculating that the U.S. hemp-derived CBD market will reach $5.3 billion in retail sales in 2021. This would imply a 15% increase over 2020 sales of $4.6 billion.
What’s more, Brightfield Group expects sales to reach $16 billion by 2026, driven by accelerated growth of ingestibles (tinctures, capsules, drinks). New consumers are expected to enter the market as prices continue to drop and access expands.

"The Killing Of Black Wall Street: 100 Years Gone By Since The Tulsa Race Massacre This year marks the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, which saw the destruction of a Black community in Oklahoma that, despite the brutality of state-sanctioned segregation, achieved an uncommonly strong level of commercial prosperity. The community was hailed as Black Wall Street because of the surplus level of businesses that thrived in this unlikely environment.
On May 19, the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties coordinated a hearing titled “Continuing Injustice: The Centennial of the Tulsa-Greenwood Race Massacre.” Three witnesses who lived through the Massacre testified before the subcommittee on their experiences during and after the tragedy, and their disappointment that justice still remained elusive 100 years later.
The Incident: At 4 p.m. on May 30, 1921, 19-year-old Dick Rowland left his job at a shoeshine stand on Tulsa’s Main Street to go to the bathroom. Rowland was a Black youth in a city where the laws ensured minimal interaction between the races. Blacks could not use public restrooms in that part of the city, but the management of the Drexel Building, where his shoeshine stand was located at street level, set aside a “colored bathroom” on the building’s third floor.
Rowland walked into the building, which was mostly empty because it was Memorial Day and many of the offices therein were closed. Sarah Page, a 17-year-old white girl, had to work that day — she was an elevator operator and took Rowland on his trip to the third floor.
The elevator ride up was uneventful, but on the ride down something happened that remains a mystery to this day. Page screamed as the elevator door opened and Rowland ran out into the street.
When police arrived, Page said that Rowland grabbed her arm, which caused her to scream — yet she never explained why Rowland, a decent and well-mannered youth, would suddenly behave so gravely out of character. She declined to file criminal charges against him.
Police located Rowland the next day and took him to the Tulsa courthouse, located not far from the Drexel Building. That afternoon, the Tulsa Tribune published a front-page article with the headline “Nab Negro for Attacking Girl in an Elevator” and falsely reported Rowland scratched Page’s face and tore her clothing.
In the same edition, Rowland was the subject of another article with the headline “To Lynch Negro Tonight,” which many people in Tulsa saw as a cue for vigilante action.
Around 7:30 p.m., a mob of several hundred white residents congregated in front of the Tulsa County Courthouse. A three-man delegation entered the courthouse and demanded the sheriff hand Rowland over to them. The sheriff refused.
Two hours later, a group of between 50 and 60 Black men appeared at the courthouse. Many of them were World War I veterans who fought for liberty overseas but had been denied basic civil rights in their own country. They had become frustrated at being treated as second-class citizens and were disgusted that yet another Black man faced lynching by a white mob. The men openly carried guns and informed the sheriff at the courthouse that they would help to defend Rowland against the mob.
News of the standoff quickly spread throughout the city, and both sides saw their numbers reinforced with gun-toting white and Black residents. At 10 p.m., a white man attempted to disarm a Black man. A shot was fired — by whom is unknown — and chaos erupted.

Viola Fletcher’s Testimony: Viola Fletcher was introduced to the congressional subcommittee as the oldest living survivor of the Massacre. Although her slight demeanor within a wheelchair gave the impression of physical frailty, Fletcher spoke with a clarity that demanded attention.
“I am 107 years old and have never seen justice,” she said. “I pray that one day I will. I have been blessed ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",2021-05-30T22:31:03Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/05/21293015/the-killing-of-black-wall-street-100-years-gone-by-since-the-tulsa-race-massacre,0

"Tesla And Baidu Lead The QQQ Lower Thursday U.S. indices were trading lower Thursday despite slightly better-than-expected U.S. jobs data.

"Unusual Options Activity Insight: SPDR S&P 500 Shares of SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $421.67.

Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity
One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.
Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",2021-06-04T14:59:53Z,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/options/21/06/21431174/unusual-options-activity-insight-spdr-s-p-500,0
"The Week In Cannabis: Amazon, Canopy's Earnings, Africa's Largest Co., Drake, Ashley Benson And More Another busy week in cannabis saw the stock market post generalized losses, as Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) came out in support of the federal legalization of marijuana, announcing it will drop marijuana testing requirements for some of its workers.
Dave Clark, CEO of Amazon’s worldwide consumer division, said in a blog post that the e-commerce giant will actively support the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act), which would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. The bill was reintroduced in Congress last Friday.
Canopy Growth Corporation (TSX: WEED) (NASDAQ: CGC) reported its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings with a net loss for the year amounting to CA$1.7 billion ($1.41 billion), representing a CA$283 million wider loss versus FY 2020. 
The Canadian cannabis giant attributed these results to various expenses, credit losses, lower income tax recoveries, advancements of gross margins and sales reductions.
Cantor Fitzgerald’s analyst Pablo Zuanic kept a ‘Neutral’ rating on Canopy’s stock, lowering their price target to CA$30.50 from C$32.
Canopy’s quarterly business-to-business sales were stable, and therefore better than its competition and previously provided outlook, explained Zuanic in a Tuesday note.
According to the analyst, good business-to-business sales in the quarter should reveal significantly advanced March shipments, with many other cannabis companies reporting double-digit drops in adult-use shipments for the same period. “So, in that context, these are good numbers.”
Later in the week, Canopy dropped its deal with Canadian rapper Drake. Their partnership was structured around an agreement where Drake would hold a 60% stake in a cannabis brand named More Life Growth Company, while Canopy would control the remaining 40%.
Commenting on the news, Green Market Report’s Debra Borchardt told Benzinga, “Canopy Growth continues to log massive net losses which tend to overshadow the company's revenues. Despite reporting over half a billion in revenues this week, the company's continuing efforts to rightsize and clean up old deals have left a mark. Dropping Drake from the lineup this week wasn't too shocking, but it would be great if Canopy could have a week where it wasn't forced to deliver another negative news headline.""
Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo. 
Meanwhile, on Thursday and Friday, Benzinga hosted a new edition of the Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference, featuring most of the top names in the industry. Speakers discussed a wide array of topics, from building a $1 billion cannabis supplies company and the road to federal legalization to the CBD beverage market, growing cannabis in hotter climates and multi-billion dollar M&A deals.
And Hempz, a hemp seed oil-based skin and body care brand, named HBO's Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson as its new celebrity ambassador.
EFTs were all down. Over the four trading days of this week:

The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ): lost 3%.
The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO): tumbled 1.1%.

It was never nominated for any of the music industry awards for that year.
While it may never have been the most profound or provocative pop music offering, “Margaritaville” wound up launching a multi-billion-dollar business empire that is coming off a COVID-19 pandemic-induced pause with two new high-profile projects.
What Happened: Buffett’s Margaritaville Enterprises LLC operates a wide network of restaurants, casinos, hotels, real estate holdings, merchandising and media platforms across North and South America and the Caribbean.

A special committee of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies passed a bill that would enable cannabis cultivation for medicinal and industrial purposes.
After being postponed on several occasions, the passing of this project meant a defeat for the conservative pro-Bolsonaro ruling party, which, according to O Globo, was firmly opposed to the bill and acted accordingly. Indeed, the battle was a close one: with 17 votes in favor and 17 against, the tie had to be broken by the chairman of the special committee, deputy Paulo Teixeira (PT-SP).

"Wall Street Crime And Punishment: The Rise And Fall Of Crazy Eddie Does crime pay?
Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction.
If you were living in the New York metropolitan area during the 1970s and 1980s, you probably remember the commercials for the Crazy Eddie electronics retail chain. They were impossible to miss: More than 7,500 spots featuring a frenetic, motor-mouthed spokesperson bombilating frenetically about the “in-saaaaaaaaane” discounts offered by the store.
Crazy Eddie was never the biggest retail operation in the region. At its peak, there were only 43 locations spread across four states.
But the ubiquity of the commercials made it seem more prominent than it actually was, and the excess attention eventually brought harsh spotlights on the financial chicanery perpetrated by its chief executive, Eddie Antar.
An Audacious Start: Eddie Antar was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Dec. 18, 1947, the grandson of Syrian Jewish immigrants. Antar was an intelligent youth but found school boring, dropping out at 16 to work odd jobs before setting up a small stand at New York’s Port Authority in the heart of Manhattan where he sold portable televisions. While Antar belatedly realized he had the wrong product line in the wrong location, he used the experience to sharpen his sales skills.
By 1969, Antar saved up enough money to go into business with his father Sam and cousin named Ronnie Gindi, creating a retail operation called ERS Electronics. They opened an electronics store in the Kings Highway business shopping district in Brooklyn called Sights and Sounds.
At the time, small and independently-owned electronics retailers operated at a significant disadvantage against major chains due to the fair trade laws of the era that enabled manufacturers to establish a single standard retail price all retailers needed to list. To stand out from the competition, Antar challenged the laws by marking down his merchandise, thus offering a discount absent elsewhere in this retail sector.
Some manufacturers got wise to this and refused to do business with Antar, but he circumvented their boycott by purchasing excess stock from other businesses and obtaining products through grey-market channels from overseas sources.
The stress was great and Gindi eventually lost interest in the enterprise, selling his one-third of the business to Antar.
But how could the store remain afloat financially through its seemingly reckless discounting? As Antar’s father Sam would later recall in an interview, the lo-fi nature of old-school retailing work enabled them to put their ethics on hold.
“Back then, most customers paid in cash,” he said. “If we don’t disclose the sale, we keep the sales tax. That’s a good cushion to be able to afford to beat the competition.”
Sights and Sounds began to attract bargain hunters from outside of Brooklyn and Antar turned into something of a one-man, in-store comedy show, going so far as taking the shoes of cash-strapped customers who wanted to buy stereos for deposits and jokingly preventing shoppers from leaving unless they made a purchase.
Antar’s shtick was so amusing that his first wife Deborah came home one evening in 1971 with a story about how one of her co-workers was talking about his shopping trip to Sights and Sounds.
The co-worker, who was unaware of Deborah’s connection to the store, talked happily about dealing with a salesperson that he dubbed “Crazy Eddie.” At that point, Antar decided to change the name of Sights and Sounds ...",2021-06-18T16:50:46Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/06/21596990/wall-street-crime-and-punishment-the-rise-and-fall-of-crazy-eddie,0

“Every 23 seconds, a person’s life is ruined for simply possessing drugs,” said Queen Adesuyi, policy manager for National Affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA). “Drug possession remains the most arrested offense in the United States despite the well-known fact that drug criminalization does nothing to help communities, it ruins them. It tears families apart and causes trauma that can be felt for generations. The drug war has caused mass devastation to Black, Latinx, Indigenous and low-income communities and today we say, ‘Enough is enough!’”
In Maine, lawmakers approved a similar bill to decriminalize all drugs on Friday.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards signed off on House Bill 652 to decriminalize small amounts of cannabis possession for personal use.
Possession of up to 14 grams will now be categorized as a misdemeanor rather than a felony. Those caught violating the law face up to a $100 fine without jail time.
Connecticut is on the verge of becoming the latest state to legalize marijuana for adult use, after lawmakers finally sent a cannabis reform bill to Gov. Ned Lamont’s desk on Thursday morning, the 50th anniversary of President Richard Nixon’s declaration of the war on drugs.
Gov. Lamont, who previously threatened to veto it over the eleventh-hour amendment, is now expected to sign the bill that will legalize the use and possession of up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis by adults 21 and older as of July 1. However, the launch of commercial cannabis sales is not expected to begin until May 2022.
Cannabis stocks traded down, underperforming general markets. Over the five trading days of this week:

The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ): lost 7.5%.
The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO): fell 7.1%.
The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (NYSE: MSOS): dropped 6.6%.
The Cannabis ETF (NYSE: THCX): was down 5.4%.

In the business world, cannabis tech firm WM Holding Company, LLC (NASDAQ: MAPS), known for its Weedmaps brand, started trading on the Nasdaq, following a merger with investment management firm Silver Spike Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: SSPK). 
Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits, one of the top 15 alcohol distributors in the U.S. will soon offer Marley CBD beverages and confections, Benzinga learned exclusively ahead of an official announcement.
The deal between cannabis company Docklight Brands and Southern Glazer's will originally span across 7 states. The latter will leverage its 42 distribution centers, 14.8 million square feet of warehouse space and fleet of more than 2,600 delivery trucks, to make sure Marley CBD products reach as many consumers as possible.
The companies assure more states will be added in the coming months.
Policy, Science, Data And Advocacy
With cannabis being legal in some form in 47 states and with federal legalization just around the corner, the National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) released a summary of scientific, historical and medical uses of cannabis designed to inform policymakers and medical professionals.
Rhode Island's Senate Judiciary Committee approved an adult-use cannabis bill, marking the first time a cannabis proposal of its nature has ever reached the state General Assembly floor.
California is injecting $100 million into the state's struggling legal cannabis industry.
A new measure, proposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, was approved by the California Legislature on Monday and aims to help legal cannabis operators acquire permanent licenses.
According to Newsom’s office, about 82% of the state’s legal operators still hold provisional licenses as of April 2021. These provisional licenses are due on Jan. 1, 2022.
Viola cannabis brand, launched by NBA veteran Al Harrington and named after his grandmother, announced on Wednesday that it has a new incubator partner - Mezz Brands.

"The SPY Flies Higher, Options Traders Look The Other Way The SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) gave traders a scare on Friday when the ETF gapped down and closed the day almost 2% lower. The SPY made a bearish double top pattern on June 14 and 15 at a new all-time high of $425.46 and then fell in consolidation.
The drop was accelerated on June 16 when the Federal Reserve raised its inflation expectations and spooked the markets.
On Monday morning, the SPY was trading over 1% higher but that didn’t stop institutions from purchasing almost $3 million in put contracts. The options traders may be betting the SPY is about to create a bull trap and head lower or they may be using the SPY to hedge other bullish positions they own.

Why It’s Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays market price for the call option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately.
These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position.

"Apple's Stock Attempts Bullish Break, Options Traders Hammer Calls Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) attempted a bullish break up out of the symmetrical triangle pattern in which it had been trading since making a new all-time high of $145.09 on Jan. 25. The months-long consolidation pattern had the stock trading into a tightening pattern, making lower highs and higher lows on the daily chart.
Despite a number of options traders purchasing large put contracts on the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY), and Apple being a market leader, options traders took the other side of Apple and purchased a massive amount of call contracts. Together, these options traders bought over $4.22 million worth of bullish Apple calls.

"The Week In Cannabis: CT Goes Legal, O'Brien Smokes On TV, A New Extraction Giant And More In another busy week, cannabis stocks traded up, outperforming general markets.
Over the five trading days of this week:

The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ): gained 4.2%.
The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO): advanced 6.6%.
The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (NYSE: MSOS): rose 6.6%.
The Cannabis ETF (NYSE: THCX): was up 4.2%.
The Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (NYSE: CNBS): surged 3.2%.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) closed the week up 2.84%.

Connecticut Goes Legal
Connecticut became the 19th state in the U.S. to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes.
The bill, signed into law by Gov. Ned Lamont, allows adults 21 and older to possess up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis. It goes into effect on July 1; the sale of recreational marijuana is planned to kick off in May 2022.
Following the move, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Pablo Zuanic shared his insights on the new market.
According to the analyst, this should be particularly beneficial to Curaleaf Holdings (OTCQX: CURLF) and Green Thumb Industries (OTCQX: GTBIF), the only two vertically integrated cannabis operators in Connecticut.
“Medical retailers and producers will be grandfathered into the program,” Zuanic said.
New recreational store licenses will be provided via a lottery system with half of the licenses being reserved for social equity applicants. The limit is set to two stores per company, based on which Trulieve Cannabis (OTCQX: TCNNF) can apply but Curaleaf cannot.
A New Extraction Giant
Cannabis extraction companies Precision Extraction Solutions and Cascade Sciences entered into a merger agreement to create a new company called Sinclair Scientific, the largest cannabis and hemp extraction equipment and services company in the world.
Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo. 
The companies will boast a combined annual revenue of over $100 million.
Conan Lights Up And Other Celeb Moves
With his late-night talk show coming to end after more than a decade, Conan O’Brien apparently decided to go out in a hail of smoke. On Tuesday’s show, the host and his guest Seth Rogen shared a joint on live television.
Anthony Joshua OBE, a British professional boxer, two-time unified world heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist signed a three-year endorsement agreement with one of the UK’s largest CBD and hemp products suppliers, Love Hemp Group PLC (AQSE: LIFE) (OTCQB: WRHLF).
Pureis Ultra Pure CBD unveiled three new brand ambassadors: actress and TV personality Martine McCutcheon; rugby legend Mike Tindall MBE and 20-time champion jump jockey, Sir AP McCoy OBE.
Ocean Grown Extracts, a family-owned cannabis company with a profound focus on social justice, has launched EVIDENCE, a brand that packages its flower in police-style evidence bags with the intent of not-so-subtly compelling customers to reckon with the racial disparities surrounding drug-law enforcement. 
EVIDENCE launched on the eve of Juneteeth with a short film produced in collaboration with artist and cannabis activist Damian Marley, EVIDENCE creative director Nabil Elderkin (known for his work with Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean and John Legend), Dan Dalton as well as cannabis entrepreneur, artist and philanthropist Berner.
US Federal And State Cannabis News
A group of House Representatives released a measure that could override a long-standing presidential denial of recreational marijuana sales in Washington D.C.
While adults over 21 are allowed to grow and possess marijuana, commercial sales remain barred by a rider that has been consistently included in all presidential budget proposals since 2014.
The Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee reviewed a bill that would ask the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to run clinical trials on the potential benefits of cannabis for the treatment of military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. 
The measure, sponsored by chairman Jon Tester (D-MT) and Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK), was discussed along with another 20 veteran-related bills although only the cannabis measure was not openly discussed but rather received written testimony opposing it.
The Rhode Island Senate approved the legalization of marijuana for adults on June 22, entering the race to become the 20th state to legalize recreational cannabis. The bill is now heading to the state House Of Representatives.
Cannabis sales in Benzinga's home state of Michigan totaled $148.9 million in May, dropping by 3% month-over-month.
According to the Michigan Marijuana Regulatory Agency, medical cannabis sales declined 1.5% year-over-year and 8% to $44.5 million while recreational sales dropped by 1% sequentially to $104.4 million, representing a 165.6% increase compared to the same month of 2020.
International News
Cannabis sales in Canada hit CA$309.7 million ($251.7 million) in April, representing a 3.8% increase compared to March and a 73.6% year-over-year spike, according to new data from Statistics Canada.
After kicking off 2021 with two consecutive sequential declines of 6%, Canadian cannabis sales are back on track, having climbed 14% in March followed by a slight increase in April.
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime issued its 2021 World Report in which it suggested placing a global ban on cannabis advertising.

"EXCLUSIVE: Carol Roth Slams Washington For Its 'War On Small Business' Carol Roth is one of the more articulate commentators on the state of the economy.
The self-described “recovering investment banker” and creator of the legacy planning system Future File, she topped the best-seller lists her 2010 book “The Entrepreneur Equation,” hosts the influential podcast “The Roth Effect” and has been a frequent guest on major cable television business programs.
Her latest book is “The War on Small Business: How the Government Used the Pandemic to Crush the Backbone of America,” published by HarperCollins, a subsidiary of News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). In her book, Roth details what she describes as a federal government that continuously kowtows to Wall Street while heaping abuses on small business — a situation that became increasingly acute during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this exclusive interview with Benzinga, Roth speaks frankly about how small business needs to find its strength to stand up not only for its rights under the law, but for its very survival.

Benzinga: In your book, you describe government as being the number one risk to today’s small business sector. Why is that?
Carol Roth: It used to be that if you were a business owner, you would be thinking about things like, 'How am I going to find customers? How am I going to find employees?’ and so forth. But never in United States history have we had a situation where the government would come in, shut you down for months on end “for the public good” and not give you appropriate compensation. So, that is now a factor that sits on top of all of these other issues that makes it very difficult to run a small business.
The U.S. government has inserted itself into the process of the “free market.” And now, the small business owners have to compete with government pay in order to find workers. Today, we're seeing 9.3 million jobs that were left unfilled, many of those affecting small business owners.
[The] government’s interruption of the market by trying to switch on and switch off and then switch back on large swathes of the economy has also disrupted the supply chain. That has caused issues related to inflation of goods — not being able to access raw materials, shipping disruptions, everything.
All of the issues that the small business owner has been contending with over the last 15 months is directly related to the government's reaction to the pandemic, and that makes it the top risk.
Benzinga: The U.S. is a bit different from other countries in dealing with the pandemic because not only did we have the federal reaction, we also had state governments and, in many cases, city governments reacting as well.
In your book, you cite several governors like New York's Gov. Andrew Cuomo, California’s Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as having the most negative impact on small business. What did governors do that was so very wrong?
Carol Roth: We just had a tournament on Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) where we let people vote for the absolute worst governor for small business. Gavin Newsom of California came out on top, just beating Andrew Cuomo on that one.
Basically, they were incredibly tyrannical in their approach. But they were also picking winners and losers not based on data and science, but based on who had political clout and connections. In some cases, a hair salon or a nail salon would be shut down as a small business, but down the street ...",2021-06-29T17:10:08Z,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/06/21767366/exclusive-carol-roth-slams-washington-for-its-war-on-small-business,0

"Cantor Fitzgerald: Curaleaf's Clever European Plans And Co. Chairman Opines On Schumer Bill Cantor Fitzgerald's Pablo Zuanic recently spoke with Curaleaf (OTCQX: CURLF) chairman Boris Jordan about federal and state regulatory changes and the company’s plans both here and across the pond. 
The Analyst
Zuanic reiterated an ‘Overweight’ rating and kept the price target of $26.50 as well as estimates on Curaleaf’s stock. 
Call Highlights 
Jordan said Curaleaf is optimistic with regards to regulatory changes both at federal and state levels, Zuanic wrote in a Thursday analyst note.
The cannabis giant's chairman is expecting to Sen. Chuck Schumer’s marijuana reform bill to be introduced this July and views it as a “compromise bill” that will contain provisions regarding banking and tax reform. Though Jordan said he believes the bill will “have enough wording that would allow the US exchanges (and TSX) to uplist US (cannabis) plant-touching companies.” 
If this is the case, multi-state operators could see higher asset values, because Canadian companies will be able to join the U.S. space through acquisitions, hence bringing “more investment funds to participate in the thriving multi-state operator sector,” said the analyst. 
According to Jordan, if the bill passes both chambers, President Biden will probably sign it.
Even if interstate trade is not regulated under the bill, Jordan expects to see it in the near future, for which Curaleaf is getting ready.

"US Adds 850K Jobs In June: What You Should Know U.S. nonfarm payroll growth in June grew by 850,000 jobs, exceeding the Bloomberg consensus estimats of 700,000 jobs added by 150,000, pointing to a faster-than-expected acceleration. Additionally, private payrolls beat expectations of 600,000 jobs added by 62,000, according to the figures released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
The unemployment rate, however, ticked up from May levels to 5.9%, in contrast to economist expectations of a decrease to 5.6%. Job gains were primarily driven by the leisure and hospitality sector (343,000 added), which was in line with expectations.
Other notable growth was seen in the public and private education, professional and business services and retail trade industries.

"The Week In Cannabis: Justice Clarence Thomas, Mexico's Decriminalization, Apple's Policy Changes, Tilray And More Below is a recap of the main news related to the cannabis industry and markets for the week of June 28, 2021.
Justice Thomas          
Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court’s longest-serving member, issued a crude statement on federal cannabis prohibition, highlighting irregularities in the federal government’s approach to marijuana policy.
Thomas, who has served in the Supreme Court for almost 30 years and is often viewed as among the most conservative, said “once comprehensive, the Federal Government’s current approach is a half-in, half-out regime that simultaneously tolerates and forbids local use of marijuana.”
The Judge went so far as to say that prohibition of intrastate cannabis use or cultivation may no longer be necessary “to support the Federal Government’s piecemeal approach.”
The government, according to Thomas, has sent mixed signals on its position regarding cannabis prohibition.
While on the one hand, federal law still “flatly forbids the intrastate possession, cultivation, or distribution of marijuana,” the federal government has consistently allowed these acts.
All details here.
Mexico
Mexico's Supreme Court voted down the country’s cannabis prohibition laws in an 8-3 vote.
The passage comes after the Senate and Congress missed several High Court-ordered deadlines to pass revised legislation.

Under the Supreme Court decision, citizens are now allowed legal access to cannabis, negating the previous exclusivity to medical patients. Citizens can now be issued permits for adult use and cultivation through the Health Department until legislation is passed.
Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo. 
The ruling does not approve of citizens turning to the illicit market in the meantime. Rather, cultivation laws allow a person to grow six plants for personal use, with a cap of eight per household.
Apple’s Policy Changes
As first reported by TechCrunch and WeedWeek, the ongoing conundrum between cannabis and tech took its latest turn last month, when Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) updated its policies to allow pot-centric apps onto its store.
Under its new policy, Apple created leeway that allows ""licensed and otherwise legal cannabis dispensaries"" from working with Apple. Companies must also be geofenced to qualify for store listing.
The decision was not a cannabis-specific one made by Apple. Instead, the move came as part of the company's attempt to curtail fraudulent apps that scam consumers across the marketplace.
Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL), which announced its ban on cannabis apps in 2019, continues to stick with its policy regarding its Google Play store.
The decision comes as tech giants continue to handle cannabis apps and accounts in often unclear ways.
Markets
Over the five trading days of this week:

The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ): lost 2.5%.
The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO): closed almost flat.
The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (NYSE: MSOS): rose 1.3%.
The Cannabis ETF (NYSE: THCX): was down 1.6%.
The Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (NYSE: CNBS): tumbled 0.7%.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) closed the week up 1.68%.

GrowGeneration Corp (NASDAQ: GRWG) was added to the Russell 2000 Index.
Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ: TLRY) released a proxy statement with an open letter from the company’s CEO Irwin D. Simon, in which he called on shareholders to support a proposal to be discussed up at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting.
Simon asked shareholders to support a proposal that will allow the company to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, enabling it to make acquisitions for growth. He also asked shareholders to authorize several amendments and changes to the company’s organizational documents that would expand shareholders' rights.
Also this week, the company announced that its SweetWater Brewing Company launched its first Canadian craft cannabis brew in the U.S. in collaboration with Canada's Broken Coast Cannabis Ltd.
Sha’Carri Richardson
American sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson, who won the hearts of millions of sports fans, lost her chance to shine at this year's U.S. Olympics after she tested positive for cannabis.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency confirmed Friday that Richardson has accepted a one-month suspension by which the results of her Olympics trials have been ""disqualified, and she forfeits any medals, points, and prizes"" as allowed under the international anti-doping regulations.
A Weak Q2
The Global Cannabis Stock Index fell for the fourth straight month, dropping 4.1% to 57.10.
During the second quarter, the index was down 8.7%.
After gaining 5.2% in 2020 when it ended at 44.39, the index is up 28.6% in 2021 and has gained 94.2% over the past year.
The index dropped 38.3% from its 2021 closing high of 92.48 on February 10.
In addition, it had 46 qualifying members during the month, following the quarterly rebalancing at the end of March as well as Aphria’s merger with Tilray and Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC’s (NASDAQ: JAZZ) acquisition of GW Pharma (NASDAQ: GWPH) in May.

"Why The Tight US Labor Market May Be Here To Stay In a series of blog posts last week, Commonwealth Financial Network chief investment officer Brad McMillan discussed just what’s going on with labor shortages in the U.S. economy.
The $300-per-week emergency federal unemployment supplement has taken a lot of the blame for the lack of available workers, but McMillan said there is a much larger and longer-term trend in play.
OK, Boomers: McMillan said there were more job openings than workers to fill them in the U.S. economy even prior to the pandemic. A long-term graph of the number of job openings subtracted from the number of unemployed Americans reveals the number of surplus jobs has been trending lower ever since the financial crisis in 2008 and dipped into negative territory back in 2018.

"Wall Street Crime And Punishment: The Savings And Loan Crisis, An Imperfect Storm That Rained Chaos Does crime pay?
Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction.
For many years, the savings and loan industry saw itself through the spectrum of the classic film “It’s a Wonderful Life,” with Jimmy Stewart running the world’s most holistic financial institution while earning eternal love from his community of customers.
But reel life is not the same as real life, and good ol’ Jimmy Stewart-types were never in surplus supply in the financial services world.
By the 1980s, the savings and loan institution (S&L) world looked less like “It’s a Wonderful Life” and more like an unholy mash-up of “Wall Street” and “Titanic” — and the wreckage residue from the industry’s crash can still be found if one looks closely.
When Good Times Go Bad: S&Ls, also known as thrifts, can be traced back to Pennsylvania in 1831. These institutions primarily focused on serving consumers through savings accounts and personal use lending, particularly mortgages.
S&Ls took on new prominence with the passage of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, which established the Federal Home Loan Bank System as a liquidity source for S&Ls. This was during the midst of the Great Depression and President Herbert Hoover was eager to reanimate the housing market by making low-cost mortgages available to would-be homebuyers.
S&Ls thrived in the post-World War II years when returning servicemembers were eager to buy new homes. By 1980, there were approximately 4,000 S&Ls with $600 billion in total assets, of which approximately $480 billion were in mortgages — half of the entire home mortgage market.
S&Ls were mostly smaller than commercial banks and had more restrictions on the types of activities they could pursue. Unlike banks, S&Ls could only rely on short-term passbook savings to fund their long-term, fixed-rate home mortgages.
This was not a problem for these institutions during years of prosperity and economic serenity — indeed, S&L failures were relatively rare before things began to go awry into the 1970s when inflation and interest rates were on the rise, along with unemployment levels. This situation created a maturity mismatch with the S&Ls stuck in lower interest rate long-term mortgages while paying higher interest rates to their depository customers — and the decline in homebuying during this period made a bad situation worse.
And then, it got even worse when the Federal Reserve under the leadership of Paul Volcker raised short-term interest rates from 9.06% in June 1979 to 15.2% in March 1980.
By mid-1982, the entire S&L industry staggered through collective losses of nearly $9 billion and every institution within this sector had a negative net worth.
A Solution Is Offered: The U.S. Congress looked upon the problems being faced by the S&Ls and decided that these institutions could quickly bounce back to strong health if there was less regulation placed on them.
The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 enabled S&Ls to expand their product offerings, including transaction accounts instead of merely savings accounts, and adjustable-rate mortgages instead of the fixed-rate products, which created financial straight jackets during the maturity mismatch period.
S&Ls also began to enjoy operational liberties that they never had before, including the elimination of loan-to-value ratios and interest rate ...",2021-07-09T12:30:27Z,https://www.benzinga.com/government/21/07/21886681/wall-street-crime-and-punishment-the-savings-and-loan-crisis-an-imperfect-storm-that-rained-chaos,0

A New Cannabis ETF

There’s a new cannabis ETF in town, and it’s leveraged.

Launched by ETF Managers Group (ETFMG), the thematic exchange-traded fund issuer behind the world’s largest cannabis ETF, the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ), ETFMG 2x Daily Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJXL) is designed to seek daily leveraged exposure of 2x to the performance of its Prime Alternative Harvest benchmark index.

Weed Delivery On The App Store

Eaze became the first cannabis delivery company to launch an app on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)’s App Store, which recently changed its policies to allow cannabis-focused apps on its store.

“The shoppable Eaze app is a major milestone for the legal cannabis market and consumers,” the company stated.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

Via the new app, users can complete registration ID, verification, product selection, payment and, best of all, doorstep delivery.

Markets

Over the four trading days of this week:


The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ): lost 3.6%.
The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO): tumbled 2.9%.
The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (NYSE: MSOS): rose 1.3%.
The Cannabis ETF (NYSE: THCX): was down 2.8%.
The Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (NYSE: CNBS): tumbled 2.6%.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) closed the week up 0.4%.


FBI Reconciles With Pot

The FBI has quietly loosened its policies regarding past marijuana consumption among its potential agents.   

Candidates who have not consumed marijuana for over one full year prior to their application date can now be considered for a job with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The FBI’s previous policies required would-be agents to have abstained from any form of marijuana or cannabis in any location (domestic or foreign), for at least three years.

Sundial And SunStream Bancorp

Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ: SNDL) raised its financial commitment to SunStream Bancorp Inc by CA$350 million($282.4 million), taking the total investment to CA$538 million.

Sundial announced in March the launch of a 50/50 joint venture with SAF Opportunities LP - a member of the Canadian alternative investment management firm SAF Group - through a new corporation, SunStream Bancorp.

The entity was formed to create investment opportunities in the cannabis space by issuing loans, as well as hybrid investments in cannabis businesses and marketable securities.

In addition, the joint venture was projected to pursue other opportunities as well, including a Canadian SPAC.

Regulatory Updates

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee signed into law a bill that will establish a safe consumption site pilot program wherein people can test as well as use illicit drugs in a medically supervised environment, making Rhode Island the first state in the nation to establish such a program, which supporters say will save lives.

The legislation was approved by the House of Representatives in late June after many starts and stops.

Sha’Carri Richardson’s recent cannabis controversy seems to have encouraged the Nevada Athletic Commission to unanimously decide to change its anti-doping policy on Wednesday and no longer suspend athletes for marijuana possession or use.

Athletes in Nevada will now not have fear automatic disqualification from their sport for smoking pot. 

Financings And M&A

Edwards, who served four terms as governor of Louisiana followed by 8½ years in prison on multiple corruption charges, died Monday morning at his home in Gonzales, Louisiana, at the age of 93 from complications related to respiratory problems.

Edwards entered politics in 1954 and won an election to become a councilman for Crowley, Louisiana, a seat that he held until he won an election to the Louisiana State Senate in 1964. He served less than two years before getting elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Louisiana’s 7th Congressional District, a seat that he held from 1965 to 1972.

"Wall Street Crime And Punishment: Thomas F. Quinn's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Does crime pay?
Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction.
In August 1988, French authorities arrested an American expatriate named Thomas F. Quinn for orchestrating a global securities scheme that defrauded investors out of $500 million.
As an unapologetic financial miscreant with a lifelong penchant for fraud, the French escapade represented something of a career peak for Quinn, whose flair of swindling took on an astonishing level of organizing that left no corner of the world untouched.
Illusory Assets For Sale: Thomas Francis Quinn was born in Brooklyn in 1932; his father drove a cement truck and his mother was a housewife who made extra money selling clothing and jewelry from the family’s garage.
Quinn was an altar boy in his childhood and was the first member of his family to pursue higher education, graduating from St. John’s University Law School and passing the bar in 1962.
Quinn opted to go into business for himself, starting a brokerage firm in New York called Thomas, Williams & Lee. The main focus of this firm became the promotion of Kent Industries, a company that claimed to own Florida property valued at $2 million.
There was a slight problem — Kent Industries didn’t own anything in the Sunshine State, and this inconvenient fact helped to introduce Quinn to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Long story short: Quinn received a lifetime banishment from the SEC in 1966 from doing business with brokers and dealers thanks to what the agency defined as his “flagrant fraudulent practices” related to the Kent Industries assets, which the regulator considered to be “almost completely illusory.”
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) was a bit slower in dealing with Quinn, but by 1970 he was sent to jail for six months and was later permanently disbarred from practicing law.
A Job With The Mob: Prior to losing his law license, Quinn gained a partnership in a New York-based securities law firm that set off several alarms among federal law enforcement agencies. Indeed, an FBI report from 1983 recalled this firm’s chief focus was being responsible for the “funds of hoodlum-controlled companies.”
Quinn was on both the FBI’s and SEC’s respective radars in the early 1980s for his role with two companies, Sundance Gold Mining and Aquarius Gold Exploration, that claimed to have discovered gold in Suriname. The companies created a flurry of excitement among investors, but an investigation into their operations found a hitherto undeclared connection with the Genovese crime family.
The SEC filed a civil complaint against Quinn in 1983, charging him with fraudulently manipulating and promoting the companies’ stocks.
Three years later, he reached a settlement with the regulator by agreeing to permanently stay away from anything related to securities.
The FBI, despite finding Mafia fingerprints in Quinn’s business affairs, declined to press charges against him.

US Federal Legalization

The United States seems to be on the verge of ending the decades-long prohibition of cannabis, as a discussion draft of a long-anticipated Senate bill that will federally legalize marijuana has been released.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and fellow Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced the outline of the proposed Cannabis Administration & Opportunity Act on Wednesday.

The discussion draft is not yet a formal bill; sponsors are now asking for public input to refine the legislation before the formal introduction.

The proposal includes plans to remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act. If passed, the bill would also expunge prior convictions and allow people who are serving time for applicable crimes to petition for resentencing, according to Chicago Sun-Times.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

In addition, states would keep their rights to set their own marijuana policies and help those who've been criminalized over the cannabis plant.

Finally, the proposal would regulate and tax marijuana, like alcohol and tobacco.

Moreover, under the Schumer bill, regulatory authority over cannabis will be transferred from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).

Markets

Despite the good news, cannabis stocks traded down. Over the five trading days of this week:


The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ): lost more than 9%.
The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO): tumbled 7.4%.
The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (NYSE: MSOS): fell 8%.
The Cannabis ETF (NYSE: THCX): was down 10.1%.
The Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (NYSE: CNBS): declined 8.3%.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) closed the week down 1%.


Biden’s New Drug Czar

President Biden has chosen the former chair of the West Virginia Medical Cannabis Advisory Board, Dr. Rahul Gupta, as the new head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the nation’s main body governing drug policy issues.

The nomination still awaits confirmation by the Senate.

The decision could have implications in the country’s position on federal cannabis policy, considering Gupta's substantial role in the development of West Virginia’s medical marijuana program.

Gupta, who also served as West Virginia’s health commissioner, has led Biden’s transition team on drug policy issues and would be the first physician to serve as the country’s so-called drug czar.



Argentina

Argentina’s Senate approved a regulatory framework for the development of its medical cannabis and industrial hemp sectors in a 56-5 vote with one abstention.

The bill titled ""Regulatory framework for the development of the medical cannabis and hemp industry,"" within the framework of the Economic and Social Council was previously introduced by Argentina’s Minister of Productive Development, Matías Kulfas, about a month ago. 

Supporters of the law say it will enable Argentine to create some 10,000 jobs in the hemp production chain. What’s more, both medical and hemp domestic sales are projected to yield $500 annually in addition to another $50 million per year in exports of both medical cannabis and hemp products, according to Argentina’s Ministry of Development. 

Up until now, Argentina has had a confusing medical cannabis access law, which was ideal for importers. In the case of the proposed regulation becoming law, companies that import into Argentina will face serious competition in the form of domestic producers.

WADA vs. The US

The beat goes on as agencies play the blame game while the fastest woman in the world is still sitting out the 2021 Olympics.

"Options Traders Feeling Market Fear Hammer The SPY Puts The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) continued to pull back from its $437.92 all-time high on Friday. The SPY reached the record price twice on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, creating a bearish double top pattern.
The pullback has been attributed to inflation worries and increased spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, but for bullish investors a pullback prior to big tech earnings allows for a sigh of relief because a run-up into earnings often becomes a ""sell the news"" event.
The three largest holdings in the SPY ETF consolidated Friday. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), which makes up 5.52% of the SPY, closed slightly lower while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), at 5.28%, failed to get follow-through on a new all-time high and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), at 3.8%, closed down over 1%.
While a number of bullish options traders purchased call contracts of the SPY, the Friday afternoon trades skewed overwhelmingly toward the bears. Together bearish traders bet over $9.12 million the SPY has room to fall further.
See Also: Wall Street Crime And Punishment: Thomas F. Quinn's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World
Why It’s Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays the market price for the call or put option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately.
These types of option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position.

"Bond Market Pricing In At Least One Interest Rate Hike In 2022 One of the biggest fears among investors so far in 2021 has been that higher-than-expected inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to act sooner and more aggressively with tightening measures, including potential interest rate hikes.
In the past month, bond market investors have grown less certain that the Fed will raise interest rates before 2023, but they're still pricing in a greater than 50% chance of at least one interest rate hike in 2022.
The Numbers: According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, the bond market is currently pricing in a 56.8% chance of a rate hike by December 2022. The good news for stock investors is that that chance is down from 70.2% just one month ago.

"'We Are More Than Due For Some Turbulence': Experts React To Stock Market's Worst Day In Months The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) bounced off its early Monday lows but still closed down 1.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 725 points for its worst day of 2021.
The primary catalyst driving the market lower appears to be a rise in COVID-19 cases (specifically in regards to the Delta variant) and the potential for another wave of infections to derail the global economic recovery.
Last week, the U.S. averaged 30,000 new COVID cases over a seven-day stretch, up sharply from the 11,000 cases it was averaging a month ago. At the same time, oil prices dropped after OPEC and its global allies agreed to start phasing out production cuts starting in August. The new plan calls for 5.8 million barrels per day of oil production to return completely by September 2022.

"EXCLUSIVE: ShadowTrader's Peter Reznicek On His Early Days, Tips For Success And Evolution Professional traders with a retail background are few and far between.
This is due in part to the obstacles to success — a lack of direction and understanding, psychological alignment, among other things — so few manage to pass on their wisdom.
A mentor to many, Peter Reznicek, the co-founder and head trader at ShadowTrader, is a seasoned market veteran with whom Benzinga had the honor of speaking.
Below, Reznicek details his early start, perspectives and tips for success, as well as his vision for the future.
Early Days: Reznicek began his career in music.
“This was before streaming and digital distribution,” he recalled on his experience during the brick-and-mortar days of record making. “You need marketing money, you need to press 12-inch records and mail them out to colleges and radio stations, be on phones all day begging for people to get airplay.”
After giving it his best shot, Reznicek explored other interests.
“I had an interest in the markets for a very long time and was sort of watching as the music business was winding down,” he said. “After the turn of the millennium, I decided to go in full-time.”
Turning Points: Reznicek followed the same trajectory most traders follow.
At the outset, Reznicek had little success. In all, it took him between four and five years to make substantial progress.
“It’s an evolution where you start to get it and you stop losing money. Then, you have a long time period where you’re starting to break even or just making a little, and things just sort of become clearer as time goes on.”
Reznicek recalled two turning points.
The first was learning from expert floor traders involved with thinkorswim.
“That was really the genesis of where I started to learn the broken-wing butterfly, ratio spread and things like that,” he shared.
Floor traders, according to Reznicek, had low capital requirements. As a result, they could put on strategies like the 1x2 ratio — a debit spread with an extra short option — for a low cost. (See ...",2021-07-22T16:00:12Z,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/futures/21/07/22051173/exclusive-shadowtraders-peter-reznicek-on-his-early-days-tips-for-success-and-evolution,0

U.S. Surgeon General Bashes Prohibition

U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said on Sunday that he does not think there is value to incarcerating people for marijuana use and that science should be our guide in policymaking.

“When it comes to decriminalization, I don't think that there is value to individuals or to society to lock people up for marijuana use. I don't think that serves anybody well,” Murthy told host Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Dash asked Murthy if he supported, from a health perspective, the draft bill unveiled last week by Senator Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to legalize cannabis at the federal level. Murthy replied that, when discussing marijuana, science should be at the forefront.

“I do think that, in terms of our approach to marijuana, I worry when we don't let science guide our process in policy-making,” Murthy said.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

“And we know the science tells us that there are some benefits to marijuana from a medical perspective but there are also some harms that we have to consider—and we have to put those together as we think about the right policy.”

In June, corporate giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) said it would adjust its outdated cannabis policy and told the world it will no longer test for marijuana for most of its job positions. The online retailer also declared its support for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act).

Having one of the largest companies in the U.S. openly supporting cannabis-related initiatives is an important milestone in and of itself. Now it turns out, there's more.  

The Seattle-headquartered company is apparently trying to persuade other corporations and Congress to support federal cannabis legalization.

Based on a Politico report, several advocacy and industry groups such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA), and Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC) reported having met with Amazon executives in June to talk about federal marijuana policy. 

Many cannabis legalization advocates are now looking to Amazon, hoping the company “will take the next step and use its considerable D.C. muscle to help get [the initiatives] passed,” according to Politico. 

Cannabis lobbyists in contact with Amazon have confirmed that the company has indeed gotten involved in the cannabis legalization debate in Washington, D.C. but whether the company is actively lobbying or monetarily backing the legislation is still unknown. 

“I'm quite disappointed that we've really seen no movement whatsoever at the federal level,” said Matthew Schweich, deputy director of the Marijuana Policy Project. “I think that if Amazon were able to lend its political support to federal reform and fund state-level efforts, that would be a net positive for the cannabis reform movement in this country.”

AMC is also the top holding in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE: IWM) at 0.78%.
The stock has, so far, struggled to rebound back toward its June 2 high of $72.62, which could be partly due to the Russell 2000 being unable to make a new all-time high. Unlike the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) and the Nasdaq, which both reached new all-time highs on Monday, the Russell 2000 has lagged its counterparts by failing to break above $234.53 and get a blue sky run.
On Monday AMC was trading up over 6% but struggled at a resistance level near the $40 mark. The stock is currently in a daily uptrend and needs to clear $46.55 to put in its next higher high.

The tech sector has been one of the few market sectors that has navigated the pandemic relatively well. Technology allowed many businesses to take a creative approach to reaching customers during the shutdowns.

"If You're Day Trading, You Will Probably Lose Money: Here's Why Day trading has become a popular hobby in the past year as investors around the world were faced with economic shutdowns and social distancing measures.
But while day trading may seem like a fun way to make some supplemental income or even a potential way to earn a living, studies suggest the average day trader tends to do more harm than good to their investment portfolio.
The Numbers: In a recent blog post, A Wealth of Common Sense's Ben Carlson highlighted several large studies that paint a very bleak picture of day trading as a whole:

"Why A 'Massive Wave Of Bankruptcies' Could Be Just Around The Corner The U.S. economy is steadily recovering from the pandemic, and more than $6 trillion in government stimulus appears to have prevented a worst-case economic catastrophe. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) has even nearly doubled from its pandemic lows in March 2020.
However, Stansberry Research editor Mike DiBiase recently wrote that the massive amount of corporate debt that companies accumulated in the past year and a half is setting up a tidal wave of bankruptcies that could devastate the new wave of investors that have piled into the market since the beginning of the pandemic.
AMC ‘Lunacy’: DiBiase said one of the most absurd stories of 2021 is what has happened with AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC). The movie theater business has been declining for years, and the pandemic triggered a 91% drop in AMC’s sales in 2020. AMC burned through nearly all of its cash and was admittedly just weeks away from bankruptcy.

Tilray’s Big Week

Canadian cannabis giant Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ: TLRY) (TSX: TLRY) posted its first earnings report following its merger with Aphria on Wednesday.
The financial results include a full quarter of the old Aphria — through May — and one month of the old Tilray.

The combined company reported a revenue increase of 25% in the fourth quarter of 2021, to $142.2 million, from $113.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Net cannabis revenue totaled $53.7 million, representing 36% growth.

Net revenue grew by 27% to $513.1 million during 2021, from $405.3 million in 2020, driven mainly by a 55% growth in net cannabis revenue, which amounted to $201.4 million.



Following the report, Tilray joined Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) on the list of stocks seeing the highest interest on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

Analysts were also bullish.

Bank of America analyst Heather Balsky said Tilray management reassured investors with a confident tone on the company’s earnings call. The company is now targeting $4 billion in sales in 2024, assuming U.S. cannabis reform occurs within the next 24 months. Management added that Tilray is “ideally positioned to compete in the U.S. market via CBD and THC beverages, as well as CBD edibles and other products.

Bank of America has a Buy rating and $21.50 price target for Tilray.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Pablo Zuanic said Tilray’s quarter was mixed and noisy, so much of Wednesday morning’s big move may be attributable to a short squeeze.

“In our view, cannabis sales trends were lackluster, but that can be explained by the COVID-related context (although management claimed the combined company has started to gain rec domestic share since April 2021),” Zuanic said.

Cantor Fitzgerald has an Overweight rating and $19 price target for Tilray.

Earlier in the week, Tilray subsidiary Manitoba Harvest partnered up with a consortium of industry leaders through Protein Industries Canada to develop new hemp and pea varieties with increased protein content, differential starch content and improved texture. 

And, on Thursday Tilray summoned and postponed its long-anticipated special meeting of shareholders, at which stockholders were meant to vote on two important proposals - 1) Share dilution and 2) Several governance changes with the purpose of increasing stockholder rights.

The special meeting was adjourned until Aug. 19.

The Numbers: Mortgage debt now accounts for nearly 70% of the record $10.1 trillion in U.S. household debt, but the pandemic sent mortgage rates plummeting to new all-time lows.
Prior to the pandemic, 30-year mortgage rates were flirting with the 5% level. Even after a recent uptick, they are now averaging around 2.7%.

The Numbers: Prior to the pandemic, S&P 500 companies reported $1.305 billion in 2019 net operating profits. About $485 billion of those profits (37%) went to dividends, while $729 billion (56%) went to stock buybacks.

Policy Moves: Research And Cannabis For Veterans

Buried deep in the folds of the much-anticipated and discussed ad nauseam 2,702 pages of the $1-trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill is a paragraph that refers to “establishing a clearinghouse to collect and distribute samples and strains of marijuana for scientific research that includes marijuana and products containing marijuana lawfully available to patients or consumers in a State on a retail basis.”

This means that if you work as a cannabis researcher in a legal marijuana state or even a non-legal neighboring state, you will soon no longer have to rely on subpar weed from the University of Mississippi as your only source of research marijuana and you will no longer have to apply to the DEA for approval to obtain research THC oil.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

Meanwhile, Senate Appropriations Committee approved an amendment that is meant to enable military veterans to access medical marijuana - by allowing Veterans Affairs (VA) physicians to grant recommendations in states where it is legal.

The measure, sponsored by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), is also intended to prevent the VA from interfering with or denying services to vets who choose to participate in their state’s legal program.

Louisiana Decriminalization Bill Goes Into Effect

Just over a month following Louisiana Gov. John Bell Edwards signing off on a bill to decriminalize small amounts of cannabis possession for personal use, the measure took effect.

As of Sunday, August 1, Louisianians caught possessing up to 14 grams of cannabis will face up to a $100 fine, but without jail time, Marijuana Moment reported.

Under House Bill 652, possession of smaller cannabis amounts is now classified as a misdemeanor rather than a felony.

Tilray

SweetWater Brewing Company, LLC, has ventured into the state of Michigan just weeks following the launch of a new, full-service brewery, production facility, taproom and restaurant in Colorado.

The company announced that Michigan beer lovers can now enjoy its core line of brews, including its flagship 420 Extra Pale Ale, its juicy HAZY IPA, SweetWater Oasis Premium Hard Seltzer and its recently launched 420 Imperial IPA.

Sweet Water was purchased by Canadian cannabis giant Aphria Inc. (TSX: APHA) (NASDAQ: APHA) in November 2020 in a $300 million deal, prior to Aphria's merger with Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY) earlier this year.

Also this week, Tilray said it is launching new medical cannabis edibles in Canada: two formulations of 16-gram medical cannabis-infused chocolate bars and two formulations of medical cannabis soft chews.

"8 Myths About Stock Trading Most New Traders Think Are True The right information and knowledge are among the key factors that influence a trader’s performance in the stock markets.
However, there are a few things new traders believe to be true, which can lead to poor trading decisions.
Myth #1 – Stock Trading is for the Rich
You can begin stock trading with as little as $100. Check out the minimum deposit requirement when choosing your online broker. You may wonder how to gain exposure to say Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), which has a share price of over $200, or Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), which trades higher than $2,000 per share. With stock CFDs (contract for difference), a trader can gain exposure to these high value stocks with less than $100.
Myth #2 – Stock Trading is Full of Risks
Naysayers will tell you that stock trading is too risky. Yes, stock trading doesn't guarantee returns. There are powerful risk management techniques, like portfolio diversification and placing stop loss and take profit orders, that can protect your trading account.

"Wall Street Crime And Punishment: The Mafia, Micro-Cap Market And The 'Largest Securities Fraud Takedown In History' Does crime pay?
Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction.
For many years, the Mafia experienced a public relations problem. Admittedly, much of this situation was self-inflicted. After all, when your traditional business enterprises consist of bootlegging, racketeering, extortion, narcotics, unlicensed gambling and prostitution, the chances of winning awards for corporate social responsibility are rather slim.
But that’s not to say the Mafia is completely evil. Indeed, this family-run operation has been actively involved in a wide variety of highly respectable industries including hospitality, entertainment, logistics and construction. And some mob leaders were highly active in civic engagement — most notably Chicago’s Sam Giancana, who coordinated a distinctive get-out-the-vote effort in the 1960s that has been cited by several historians as helping to bring John F. Kennedy to the presidency.
Indeed, there have been some people who viewed the Mafia as a holistic corporate entity. For example, entertainer Debbie Reynolds, who encountered several members of this organization during her years of Las Vegas residency, once commended the Mafia on how it handled human resources issues by observing, “No one got killed who wasn’t supposed to be.”
Of course, whacking recalcitrant business owners who unwisely declined bribery requests can certainly be a colorful way to make the living, but the Mafia also had a serious side, especially in regard to its desire to be an active participant in the financial services industry.
Alas, a few regrettable bad habits seeped into its efforts blend within the Wall Street environment, which pinged the radars at both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, resulting in Operation Uptick, which made the antics of Jordan “Wolf of Wall Street” Belfort look like Snoopy in comparison.
Leave The Stocks, Take The Cannoli: On the morning of June 14, 2000, 600 FBI agents and police officers rounded up 120 individuals in 13 states on charges related to such mayhem as racketeering, securities fraud, pension fund fraud, bribery of brokers and union officials, extortion, money laundering, witness tampering and solicitation to commit murder.
Those who found themselves in handcuffs that morning included 57 stockbrokers — both the licensed and unlicensed variety — along with 12 stock promoters, two accountants, an attorney, an investment advisor, a hedge fund manager and the treasurer of New York City’s police detectives pension fund.
Eleven of the arrested were simply identified as being “alleged members of Mafia crime families.” This endeavor was unusual in that it united each of the five ...",2021-08-13T16:30:45Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/08/22471903/wall-street-crime-and-punishment-the-mafia-micro-cap-market-and-the-largest-securities-fraud-takedow,0

Biden Exploring Clemency For Non-Violent Drug Inmates

President Joe Biden is considering using his executive authority to grant clemency to people serving federal prison sentences for certain non-violent drug convictions, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday.

The question came up when Psaki was asked about plans for federal inmates who were released to home confinement during the pandemic and are now expected to return back to prison. Some 4,000 federal offenders could soon be obliged to return to prison. 

“We are working hard every day to reform our justice system in order to strengthen families, boost our economy and give people a chance at a better future,” Psaki said.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

“As part of this, the president is deeply committed to reducing incarceration, helping people successfully reenter society. And he has said too many people are incarcerated—too many are black and brown,” Psaki told reporters. “And he is therefore exploring multiple avenues to provide relief to certain nonviolent drug offenders, including through the use of his clemency power.”

Cuomo Resigns: What It Means For NY Cannabis

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans to step down as of August 24.

Cuomo will be replaced by Kathy Hochul, the Lt. Governor of New York, and many industry experts believe this transition will likely put the rollout of adult-use cannabis in the state back on track. In fact, Viridian Capital Advisors believes the move “may even accelerate the timeline of initial sales from the original summer 2H/22 targets. Prior to Governor Cuomo's news, many industry participants were beginning to believe a 2023 start was most likely.

“Ms. Hochul has historically not been an avid supporter of cannabis legislation but appears to be a realist and this winter endorsed the law highlighting the New York’s budget deficit and social equity causes as motivation. Ms. Hochul is expected to be more cooperative than Governor Cuomo and we believe the new Governor may view cannabis as a popular initial (or near term) issue to champion at the start of her term thus gaining an initial win under her belt,” wrote the firm.

"The Case For A Stock Market Bubble: 'Speculation Pervading Society' The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) has more than doubled off its 2020 pandemic lows, and the S&P 500’s valuation is looking extremely stretched based on a number of traditional stock market valuation metrics.
Stansberry Research lead editor Dan Ferris recently discussed the extremes in investor sentiment in today’s market and how he believes it's an obvious red flag and warning sign of a stock market bubble.
Irrational Exuberance: One of the textbook signs of a market bubble is when stock market speculation extends beyond Wall Street and becomes commonplace among average Americans. Ferris said that’s exactly what he’s witnessed with the rise of meme stock speculation as the latest trend on social media since the beginning of the pandemic.

"Biden Defends Afghanistan Withdrawal, Blames Kabul's Fall On Afghan Military, Leaders And Trump President Joe Biden unapologetically defended his decision to withdraw U.S. military forces from Afghanistan, claiming it was not in the best interests of the American people to remain in an endless war while blaming the Taliban’s conquest of the nation on the Afghan military, the Afghan people and previous U.S. presidential administrations that conducted the military occupation of the Central Asian nation over the previous two decades.
What Went Wrong: “I stand squarely behind my decision,” Biden said in a speech delivered to the nation. “After 20 years, I've learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces. That's why we're still there.”
See Also: Taliban Fighters Enter Kabul As President Of Afghanistan Flees
Biden insisted that the initial mission in Afghanistan was to “get those who attacked us on Sept. 11, 2001, and make sure al-Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again.”
He added that the U.S. mission was “never supposed to be a nation building, it was never supposed to be creating a unified centralized democracy. Our only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what has always been preventing a terrorist attack on the American homeland.”
Biden added the terrorist threat against U.S. interests shifted to elsewhere in Asia and Africa and the U.S. in conducting missions against terrorist groups in countries where it does not have a permanent military presence. He added that “if necessary, we'll do the same in Afghanistan.”
Furthermore, the president claimed he was boxed in by a 2020 agreement that his predecessor, Donald Trump, made with the Taliban to pull out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021.
“The choice I had to make as your president was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season,” he said. “We would have been no ceasefire after May 1. There was no agreement protecting our forces after May 1.”
While admitting that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban “did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated,” he did not take any blame for strategic failings. Instead, he seemed to blame the Afghans solely for the misfortune that befell them.
“The Afghan military collapsed some time without trying to fight,” Biden said, noting that “America cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves.”
Biden blamed Afghanistan’s leadership for “being unable to come together for the good of their people [and] unable to negotiate for the future of their country.”
The president also insisted Afghan civilians didn't evacuate sooner because “some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier, still hopeful for their country, and part of it was because the Afghan government and its supporters discouraged us from organizing a mass exodus to avoid triggering, as they said, a crisis of confidence.”
Biden stated that with U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, his administration will continue to put pressure on the Taliban.

Johnson & Johnson’s Difficult Road: One company that has been a disappointing investment in the last year has been pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ).
Johnson & Johnson investors have likely been extremely disappointed with the performance of the stock in the past year given how much attention the company’s COVID-19 vaccine has gotten.
But one of the biggest problems with the vaccine thesis is that it’s unclear how much of a catalyst the vaccine will be for Johnson & Johnson beyond 2021.

"Q2 13F Roundup: How Buffett, Einhorn, Ackman And Others Adjusted Their Portfolios The latest round of 13F filings from institutional investors is out, revealing to the world the stocks that some of the richest and most successful investors have been buying and selling.
Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The second quarter of 2021 was another big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling heading into the second half of 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros buying.
Alibaba had a brutal quarter in part due to a regulatory crackdown on big tech stocks in China, and fund managers took notice. Tepper was selling while Cooperman was buying the dip.
Buffett continued accumulating Kroger shares while selling off health care investments.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite a booming U.S. Market, Cooperman invested in developed markets outside of the U.S. & Canada by buying the EFA ETF, while Smith made big bets on small and mid-cap stocks by buying the IWR and IWM funds.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

What Happened? On this day in 1982, the great bull market of the 1980s began.
Where The Market Was: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 869.29 and the S&P 500 traded at 113.02.

"Wall Street Crime And Punishment: When Enron's Numbers Didn't Add Up Does crime pay?
Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction.
Twenty years ago, Enron Corporation was considered to be among the most successful corporations. Indeed, 2001 marked the sixth consecutive year that Enron earned the title of “America’s Most Innovative Company” from Fortune magazine.
But as the year progressed, Enron’s appeal evaporated when its accounting practices were called into question and the company collapsed in one of the most dramatic corporate scandals in American history.
The Right Place And The Right Time: Enron was created in 1985 through the union of Houston Natural Gas, a gas exploration and production firm, and InterNorth, an Omaha-based pipeline network company.
InterNorth was the larger and richer of the two companies and it absorbed the Texas-based operation for $2.4 billion. Under the original acquisition agreement, the combined entity was to be known as HNG/InterNorth, with InterNorth CEO Sam Segnar at the corporate helm and the headquarters remaining in Omaha.
But one year after the transaction, Segnar abruptly retired and was succeeded by Kenneth Lay, the former Houston Natural Gas chief, who renamed the company Enron and shifted its headquarters to Houston.
When Lay took control, the company boasted the second-largest pipeline network in the nation with more than 36,000 miles of pipe. But Enron faced two major challenges: the federal government deregulated natural gas sales, thus requiring a new corporate operational strategy, and the combination of the two companies into Enron resulted in a debt load that was not easily shaken away.
The solution to Enron’s woes came via Jeffrey Skilling, a consultant with McKinsey & Co. Skilling devised an energy derivative concept called a “gas bank” that involved Enron purchasing gas from a network of suppliers and then selling it to a network of consumers. Under this strategy, Enron could charge fees for the transaction while guaranteeing supply and prices while managing risks. Skilling’s strategy worked so effectively that by the early 1990s the company became the largest seller of natural gas in North America.
The company began to divest its pipeline assets and expand beyond natural gas by bringing its “gas bank” model into different markets including coal, electric power, paper and pulp, steel and water. It also began to concentrate on a new market: broadband fiber optic, a crucial element in the decade’s fast-growing Internet environment. Lay recruited Skilling to lead a new division called Enron Finance Corp. that would coordinate the company’s diversification and paths into new corporate territories.
Unfortunately, the genius Skilling displayed in helping Enron find its feet proved to be the corporate equivalent of lightning in a bottle.
Kicking The Decimal Point Around: Skilling opted to shift Enron away from traditional accounting practices in favor of the mark-to-market method (MTM), and in 1992 the company received the blessing from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to make the switch.
Whereas traditional accounting tabulates and record actual values, MTM determines a company’s value and worth using fair value appraising. Under the MTM system, profits can be listed as projected sums rather than actual numbers.
The drawback to the MTM approach is that it could ...",2021-08-20T17:13:29Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/08/22579190/wall-street-crime-and-punishment-when-enrons-numbers-didnt-add-up,0

PharmaCann Could IPO Soon

One of the largest private cannabis companies in the world could soon go public on the OTC Markets with a valuation of more than $1 billion.

According to a report from Reuters, PharmaCann could IPO as soon as next fall, as it looks to raise funds ahead of New York’s adult-use cannabis program’s debut. Some of the sources indicated other options are still being considered, though.

Sources also mentioned PharmaCann would likely seek to list in Canada, following the steps of its competitor Ascend Wellness Holdings Inc (OTC: AAWH), which made its public debut in May and is already valued at almost $2 billion, after a surge of more than 35% in its stock price since opening.

Tilray’s Position In MedMen Convertible Notes

Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ: TLRY) acquired the majority of the outstanding senior secured convertible notes of MedMen Enterprises Inc. (CSE: MMEN) (OTCQX: MMNFF), which were originally held by certain funds affiliated with Gotham Green Partners, LLC and others. The transaction is valued at $165.8 million.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

What’s In It For Tilray? For starters, the investment provides Tilray with a potential accelerated path into the U.S. cannabis market upon federal legalization via a significant equity position in MedMen through conversion of the notes and the ability to exercise associated warrants.

Many believe federal cannabis legalization could happen sooner rather than later and Tilray’s chairman and CEO Irwin D. Simon is among them.

Following the news Cantor Fitzgerald’s Pablo Zuanic reiterated an ‘Overweight’ rating on Tilray’s stock, keeping the price target of $19 unchanged. 

The Parent Co. Appoints First Black CEO In Major Public Cannabis Company

TPCO Holding Corp. (NEO: GRAM.U) (OTCQX: GRAMF), which does business as The Parent Company, appointed Troy Datcher to serve as its new CEO, effective September 8.

Datcher's historic appointment represents the first time a Black CEO will lead a major publicly traded U.S. cannabis organization.

""I'm truly honored to be at the forefront of shaping the future of the cannabis industry with The Parent Company,"" Datcher said. 



HEXO Stock Plunges On $140M Public Offering Announcement Ahead Of Transfer To NASDAQ

HEXO Corp (TSX: HEXO) (NYSE: HEXO) announced the pricing of a previously announced overnight marketed public offering of its 47.46 million units at a price of $2.95 per unit.

The total proceeds from the offering amount to $140 million before deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses.

The move follows the company’s recent announcement that it has applied to transfer its U.S. stock exchange listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Stock Market. The transfer is expected to take place on Monday, Aug. 23, following Nasdaq’s approval.

"Here's Why There's Downside Risk To S&P 500 Earnings In 2022 Second-quarter earnings season was surprisingly strong, but Bank of America analyst Ohsung Kwon says the next few quarters of earnings could get increasingly difficult.
The Numbers: S&P 500 EPS beat consensus analyst estimates by 19% in the second quarter, well above the average 2% quarterly beat from 2000 to 2019. However, Kwon's already starting to see evidence that inflation has flipped from an earnings tailwind to a headwind as the economy deals with labor and supply chain issues.

Discovery is a media company that owns and operates national television networks, including Discovery Channel and Animal Planet. Earlier this year, Discovery announced a planned merger with WarnerMedia that is expected to be completed in mid-2022.
The stock’s total return in 2021 is just 2% after it shot higher by as much as 150% at one point this year due to a short squeeze. Its forward earnings multiple is just 38.3, the lowest in the entire S&P 500 communication services sector. Analysts have high hopes for a rebound in the next 12 months.

"If You Invested $1,000 In PayPal Stock One Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Investors who have owned stocks in the last year have generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) total return over the last 12 months is 31.2%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way.
PayPal’s Big Run: One company that has been a solid investment in the last year has been digital payments giant Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL).
Unlike many other companies, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 didn’t hurt PayPal’s business. In 2019, PayPal reported $2.07 in adjusted EPS on $17.7 billion in revenue. In 2020, EPS jumped to $3.54 and revenue grew to $21.4 billion.
In fact, economic shutdowns around the world facilitated a broad shift from cash toward digital payments, creating a tailwind for PayPal and other online and mobile payment apps. The more than $6 trillion in U.S. government stimulus measures also triggered concerns over rising inflation levels.

Historical Origin: The rule's origin is based on the concept that followers of the Jewish faith want to be free from material possessions during the most sacred period of the calendar year.

Hexo’s $925M Acquisition Of Redecan

Hexo Corp. (TSX: HEXO) (NASDAQ: HEXO) closed its $925 million acquisition of Redecan, Canada’s largest privately-owned licensed producer.

Following the news, Cantor Fitzgerald issued a new report on Hexo.

Analyst Pablo Zuanic maintained a Neutral rating but increased the 12-month price target to CA$3.45 ($2.73) from CA$3.40 ($2.70) after tweaking pro forma estimates. 

“We will remain Neutral for now, partly on a legacy of continued dilution, but if over time, all this translates to a profitable cash generating LP (one of the largest, if not the largest), then we think the stock should start to rerate at some point,” Zuanic wrote.

According to the firm’s analysis, key potential drivers for the company going forward are:


Investors getting a better sense of the scale and prowess of the combined company on an ongoing basis.
HEXO starting to report positive EBITDA in FY22.
More visibility about the company’s U.S. strategy.
Management clearly stating that further stock dilution is unlikely in the year ahead.


Later in the week, Hexo completed its purchase of 48North Cannabis Corp. (TSXV: NRTH) for $50 million.

TerrAscend Acquires Gage Growth In $545M All-Stock Deal

TerrAscend Corp. (CSE: TER) (OTCQX: TRSSF) and Gage Growth Corp. (CSE: GAGE) (OTCPK: GAEGF) have entered into a definitive agreement, under which TerrAscend will acquire all of the issued and outstanding subordinate voting shares of Gage for around $545 million.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

Upon completion of the transaction, the combined business will have operations in five states and Canada, including 7 cultivation and processing facilities and 23 operating dispensaries serving both medical and adult-use cannabis markets in the U.S. and Canada.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled on Monday against a petition to request that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reschedule cannabis in all of its forms under the Controlled Substances Acts (CSA).

The DEA Seeks To Increase Federal Production Limits For Psilocybin And Marijuana Research

The Drug Enforcement Administration is proposing a significant increase in federal limits for the production of psilocybin, psilocin and marijuana for research purposes.

In a clear proof of institutional interest for the therapeutic value of some Schedule 1 substances, the DEA is scheduled to publish a new document in the Federal Register on Thursday advocating for an increase in the aggregate production quotas for these naturally-produced substances.

The agency wants to allow for the production of 2 million grams of marijuana, or 500,000 more grams than its initial quota for this year. The DEA also wants to upscale cannabis extract production, doubling it to 500,000 grams.

Limited Upside: On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Savita Subramanian raised her year-end 2021 S&P 500 price target from 3,800 to 4,250. The new target still represents about 5.9% downside from the S&P 500’s current level of around 4,517.
Looking ahead to 2022, Subramanian set a new year-end S&P 500 target of 4,600, suggesting only about 1.8% additional upside for the index over the next 16 months.

Tilray

Shares of cannabis giant Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ: TLRY) (TSX: TLRY) traded down on Friday afternoon, after the company reported that its stockholders have approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of its common stock.

As such, the cannabis company said that with additional authorized shares, it can accelerate its progress toward its goal of delivering $4 billion in revenue, a goal Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told Benzinga it intended to achieve by the end of fiscal 2024. The company isalso looking to increase its retail market share from 16% to 30% by FY24 end.

BMW Commits To Hemp And Recycling

In its quest to reduce its carbon footprint, BMW (OTC: BMWYY) will begin using more hemp and other environmentally friendly materials inside its vehicles.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

It is no coincidence that BMW was named the world's most sustainable automaker by S&P Dow Jones last November: the company adopted new strategies that focus on the use of greener materials, some of which will be recycled.

For example, the company has been using hemp in the door panel linings of its electric i3 for some years now. This feature not only fulfills an ecological function but also plays a role in lightening the vehicle.

Their goal? To reduce the life cycle CO2 emissions of their cars by more than 40%, by 2030.

Meanwhile, the firm confirmed that it will use hemp, flax, and kenaf (a plant that has connections to cannabis) fibers to produce components such as door panels.

Italy

In Italy, the Justice Committee of the Lower House approved a reform that decriminalizes recreational consumption of marijuana and allows home cultivation of up to four plants.

What remains to be done? The vote must be debated and ratified by the Upper House before becoming law.

If approved, Italy will become the first country in Europe to decriminalize the adult use of marijuana. And one of the pioneer states in legalizing home cultivation, after Spain, and the Czech Republic.

Increased penalties

According to ANSA, Mario Perantoni, president of the Chamber of Deputies and co-author of the bill: ""The cultivation of no more than 4 female plants at home is decriminalized"".

However, the reform will increase the penalties for trafficking and sale of cannabis from six to ten years.

The European country has a rather relaxed approach, as it allows the sale of cannabis that has a high CBD percentage and a less than 0.6% of THC, in dispensary-style stores.


No Relation Between Marijuana Legalization And Increased Use Among Teenagers

A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that marijuana legalization laws are not associated with increased use amongst high school students.

“Consistent with estimates from prior studies, there was little evidence that [recreational marijuana laws] or [medical marijuana laws] encourage youth marijuana use,” reads the paper.

The study builds upon a previous paper that used data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) for the period 1993-2017, which found that marijuana adoption was associated with an 8% decrease in ...",2021-09-10T20:35:23Z,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/09/22891816/the-week-in-cannabis-tilray-bmw-teen-use-the-valens-co-flora-growth-italy-and-more,0

"Where Jobless Americans Can Get Health Insurance Coverage After The 6-Month Federal COBRA Subsidy Ends The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was signed into law in March included a provision where the federal government created a temporary subsidy to help people who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic to cover the costs of their health insurance coverage through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Under COBRA, an individual can continue to receive health care coverage from a former employer, albeit by paying their share of the monthly premium along with the share previously covered by the employer when that individual was on their payroll.
The subsidy took effect on April 1 and is set to expire on Sept. 30. Congress has no plans to extend the subsidy, which could create difficulties for those who have yet to find work that includes employer-funded health insurance. For those individuals who cannot afford to return to paying for their coverage via COBRA on their former employer’s plan, here are five options that can be considered.

Following his military service, he graduated from Boston University in 1950 and later returned to the school to teach a course on jazz history.

"Wall Street Crime And Punishment: Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco International's Big-Spending Vulgarian Does crime pay?
Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction.
In Dennis Kozlowski’s mind, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time — specifically, the courts of justice and public opinion in the early 2000s, when the corporate chieftains of Worldcom, Enron and Adelphia, not to mention the ultra-high-profile Martha Stewart, faced humiliating trials and convictions followed by prison sentences.
Kozlowski, who was convicted on 22 counts of grand larceny, conspiracy and securities fraud and served more than six years in prison following a high-profile leadership reign as CEO of Tyco International, lamented that he would never have faced a legal nightmare if his case came up during the Obama Justice Department era when prosecutions of badly behaved corporate leaders barely occurred.
“After 2008, nobody was prosecuted,” he grumbled.
But if Kozlowski’s fall from grace did not take place when the stars were aligned in his favor, he found an ally in time during his post-incarceration years, where access to friendly media outlets have helped to redefine the circumstances of his derailment and allow his reinvention as a self-described martyr to a dysfunctional justice system.
The Boom Years: Leo Dennis Kozlowski was born Nov. 16, 1946, in Newark, New Jersey. His father worked in Newark’s public transportation service and his mother did double-duty as a school crossing guard and Newark Police Department employee.
Kozlowski held a variety of odd jobs in his youth, including stints at a car wash and a pharmacy, to finance his education at New Jersey’s Seton Hall University.
He briefly worked at SCM Corporation in New York City and Cabot Corporation in Boston before joining the Nashua, New Hampshire, division of Tyco International in 1975 as an accountant with an annual salary of $28,000.
He worked his way up through the ranks, landing the chief operating officer title by 1989 and CEO spot in 1992. Kozlowski’s ascension was mirrored by Tyco’s blossoming from a somewhat sleepy little security systems company with $20 million in revenue into a global conglomerate with more than $40 billion in revenue and a market capitalization of more than $110 billion.
Tyco’s remarkable growth was based solely on the surplus number of acquisitions that Kozlowski was able to pull off during his chief executive years. A July 1998 profile of Kozlowski in Forbes marveled at how he orchestrated 88 different acquisitions during his first six years at the company’s helm, dubbing him “Deal-a-Month Dennis” for his ability to quickly secure takeovers.
While the magazine ogled at the quantity of the acquisitions, Kozlowski highlighted the quality of the deals.
""We're fully aware that most acquisitions don't work,"" Kozlowski said. ""Taking a gamble on a future revenue stream is a neighborhood we don't need to play in.""
The key to success in this area, he added, was assimilating the acquired company as quickly as possible to ensure a swift and seamless integration into the Tyco culture.
""Our obligation is to get the cost out and get that over with quickly so we can move on from there and get the growth going in the company,"" he said.
In retrospect, Kozlowski admitted his penchant for purchasing companies was sloppy around the edges.
“I did push the organization hard and we built up a large company from nothing very quickly,” he said in a June 2020 interview with the Nantucket-based N Magazine. “We went from infancy to adulthood without passing through adolescence. And in that process, we never built the infrastructure or the documentation that most companies have to support the kind of growth we had.
“We didn’t have the lawyers or financial people on staff to support the large businesses that we were running,” he continued. “I was guilty of not building a corporate staff that was comparable to the size of the organization we were running.”
Actually, there was a bit more to ...",2021-09-17T18:25:22Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/09/22976498/wall-street-crime-and-punishment-dennis-kozlowski-tyco-internationals-big-spending-vulgarian,0

FDA And CDC Issue Warnings On Delta-8 THC

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued warnings to consumers about the potential risks of consuming unregulated products that are advertised as containing the cannabinoid delta-8 THC. 

There has generally been a lack of rules governing delta-8 THC, which can be synthesized using CBD from legal hemp and is being sold in states regardless of whether they’ve legalized marijuana

According to the CDC, “Variations in product content, manufacturing practices, labeling, and potential misunderstanding of the psychoactive properties of delta-8 THC may lead to unexpected effects among consumers.”

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

According to the FDA, some manufacturers may use potentially unsafe household chemicals to make delta-8 THC through a chemical synthesis process, and additional chemicals may be used to change the color of the final product. The final delta-8 THC product may contain harmful by-products (contaminants) due to the chemicals used in this process.

Neither agency proposed banning the production or sale of the cannabinoid. The CDC encouraged consumers to be aware of possible misleading labeling and said retailers should “provide information to consumers about the psychoactive qualities of delta-8 THC,” reported Marijuana Moment.

Olympic Cannabis Ban To Be Re-Examined

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) intends to review the status of cannabis on its banned substance list, following last summer's exclusion of track star Sha’Carri Richardson from competing at the Tokyo Olympics after she tested positive for cannabis in her home state of Oregon, where marijuana is legal.

The scientific review will be conducted by a group that advises WADA in 2022.

“Following receipt of requests from a number of stakeholders, the (executive committee) endorsed the decision of the List Expert Advisory Group to initiate in 2022 a scientific review of the status of cannabis,” a WADA statement read. “Cannabis is currently prohibited in competition and will continue to be in 2022.”

Native American Cannabis Alliance, Everscore Creating World's Largest Cannabis Cultivation Source

The Native American Cannabis Alliance, a joint venture of Tim Houseberg, executive director of Cherokee Nation-based Native Health Matters Foundation, and Everscore signed three memoranda of understanding with indigenous farmers from the Mohawk Nation, Cheyenne and the Arapaho Tribal Nations.

The ground-breaking agreements will oversee the transformation of over 500,000 acres of tribal farmland into cannabis farming that will include agricultural services, the creation of manufacturing campuses to process the cannabis and workforce development, with products to be sold on the Everscore online marketplace.

"EXCLUSIVE: Fossil Fuels Advocate Alex Epstein On Energy-Focused Investing, Green Politics Alex Epstein is among the most provocative and controversial thought leaders in today’s energy sector.
As the founder and president of the Center for Industrial Progress think-tank and author of “The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” Epstein has challenged the arguments put forth by environmentalists and political activists regarding the impact fossil fuels have on the climate and the redemptive potential frequently attributed to renewable energy sources.
In this interview with Benzinga, Epstein considers the role fossil fuels and renewables play in the economy, and also offers insight on what investors should consider when weighing the publicly-traded companies involved in this ongoing debate.
Q: Where do you see the state of the fossil fuel industry for the remainder of this year and into 2022? Is this industry going to be able to withstand the various slings and arrows from the Biden administration and other green-hued people on Capitol Hill who blame it for climate change?
Epstein: It's hard to predict exactly what will happen because so much of it is political. But I think it's very important that the underlying economics in the U.S. and around the world are definitely in favor of the fossil fuel industry continuing and even expanding.
For example, if you look at what's been happening with natural gas prices — due to a lot of restrictions, particularly on pipeline capacity — we've seen more than a doubling of natural gas prices in the last year. In Europe, we're seeing a skyrocketing.
We're also seeing the inability of the renewables — or as I call them, the unreliables — to provide reliable electricity. We've seen that in California and in Texas. So, you have an interesting combination of enormous political hostility toward fossil fuels, but then I think there is an emerging understanding that they are still very much necessary and trying to get rid of them will have very negative consequences.

The Fed’s commentary suggests the U.S. economy is now on strong enough footing to stand on its own. Yet the market may lose one of its biggest growth drivers, and the elevated inflation could even have investors talking about potential interest rate hikes sooner than previously expected.
Fed Feedback: Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network, said Thursday the Fed’s willingness to taper is a good sign for the economy.

The data in the Pandora Papers was pilfered from 14 offshore service providers. The ICIJ didn't reveal the sources of the leaked documents, which the organization dubbed as the “largest investigation in journalism history exposes a shadow financial system that benefits the world’s most rich and powerful.” The same organization was responsible for the similar Panama Papers leak in 2016.

In fact, economic shutdowns around the world facilitated a broad shift from cash toward digital payments, creating a tailwind for Riot and other cryptocurrency stocks.

"Wall Street Crime And Punishment: The Mystery Of Bernie Madoff Does crime pay?
Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction.
Bernie Madoff was not a larger-than-life personality. Except for the decision to wear his hair on the longish side in the manner of an aging rock musician, there was nothing in his demeanor and behavior that secured immediate attention. Truly, one could easily pass him in a crowded store aisle or stand beside him in a time-consuming elevator ride and not be aware of his presence.
And this lack of the superstar vibe made Madoff’s actions all the more unlikely. As the man who orchestrated the largest Ponzi scheme in history — a $64.8 billion swindle that defrauded more than 40,000 people in 125 countries over four decades — the quotidian Madoff seemed closer to Hannah Arendt’s notion of the banality of evil than the pop-culture concept of the charismatic yet deranged genius eager to obliterate the world for amusement’s sake.
Indeed, there was no genius in Madoff’s madness. His reign of wreckage was not a tribute to cunning and planning, but to the dumb luck that the federal regulators who were supposed to be on alert for such shenanigans were clueless until too much damage was done.
A Sort-Of Self-Made Man: Bernard Lawrence Madoff was born in Brooklyn on April 29, 1938, and was raised in the Laurelton section of Queens. His father was an entrepreneur who had the Midas touch in reverse: every endeavor he put his hands on failed. Nonetheless, Madoff admired his father’s desire to be self-employed.
Madoff entered the University of Alabama in the 1956-57 semester. According to Madoff biographer Jerry Oppenheimer, Madoff chose this school because he was unable to get accepted anywhere else. After a year at the school, Madoff transferred back to Hofstra University in Long Island, which was closer to both his family and to Ruth Alpern, whom he met during a summer job as a lifeguard, and the two married in 1959.
Madoff graduated from Hofstra in 1960 and briefly attended law school, but dropped out to pursue his own business. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities was bootstrapped with money Madoff earned from his work as a lifeguard and as a part-time lawn sprinkler installer, plus a $50,000 loan from his father-in-law, who ran an accounting firm and encouraged clients to do business with Madoff.
But within two years of launching his business, the so-called “Kennedy Slide” bear market put Madoff’s start-up in peril and he needed another cash infusion from his father-in-law to stay independently employed.
Madoff initially focused his attention on the penny stock market, later recalling to New York magazine journalist Steve Fishman, “We were a small firm, we weren't a member of the New York Stock Exchange — it was very obvious.” Still, Madoff was willing to build his reputation and client base on the fringes of Wall Street, recalling that he happily filled a transaction involving the sale of eight bonds — a minuscule task that no major brokerage would consider but which he gladly fulfilled.
“I was perfectly happy to take the crumbs,” he stated.

Taking A Byte: To his credit, Madoff was ahead of the curve in detecting investment trends. He successfully made inroads into the institutional investor space when most of Wall Street was still fixated on retail investors, and in the early 1970s he embraced computer technology at a time when the financial services industry maintained a fetal-level dependency on paper, particularly the so-called “pink sheets” that disseminated prices for over-the-counter stocks on the cerise-hued documents.
Madoff’s firm was among the first participants in the nascent screen-based electronic market that evolved into NASDAQ, and his prescience would ...",2021-10-08T17:13:09Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/10/23285615/wall-street-crime-and-punishment-the-mystery-of-bernie-madoff,0

"Has Bitcoin Improved As A Flight To Safety Investment? Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) bulls have had a great run in the past couple of years, and many argue that the popular cryptocurrency has replaced gold as the best way to protect your portfolio from downside in the stock market.
There are plenty of reasons for investors to be seeking a safe haven for their cash these days given stocks are at all-time highs while interest rates remain historically low. Diversification is the most powerful tool for any investor to help reduce risk in a portfolio. To maximize diversification, investors need to identify market sectors and assets that have minimal correlation to each other.
When you have a portfolio of assets that are highly correlated, a market sell-off will likely drag down your entire portfolio all at once. However, if your assets have a low or even negative correlation, a stock market sell-off or a drop in one single market sector, such as the tech sector or energy sector, might not tank your entire portfolio.

The pandemic lockdowns gave workers an opportunity to rethink whether or not their low-paying jobs are worth their time, Brusuelas said. The rise of online shopping and a $15 starting wage for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is bringing a 40-year period of monopsony to a close, he said.

"Wall Street Crime and Punishment: Allen Stanford's Caribbean Ponzi Scheme Nightmare Does crime pay?
Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction.
On Feb. 20, 2008, President George W. Bush sent a congratulatory letter on White House stationery to Allen Stanford, the Houston financier whose Stanford Financial Group had recently expanded its operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
“I send greetings to the gathered in St. Croix, Virgin Islands to celebrate the expansion of Stanford Financial Group,” Bush wrote on White House stationery. “To protect their future well-being and that of their families, it is important for individuals to give careful thought to strengthening their financial security.”
Within a year of the letter being sent, Bush was out of the White House and Stanford was receiving a very different type of federal correspondence: he was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with orchestrating a $7 billion investment fraud, the second-largest Ponzi scheme in history surpassed only by Bernie Madoff’s shenanigans.
Deep in the Heart of Texas: Robert Allen Stanford was born in Mexia, Texas, on March 24, 1950. His father, James Stanford, owned an insurance brokerage and was active in local politics, serving as a city council member for 15 years and two terms as Mexia’s mayor. His mother, Sammie, was a nurse. Stanford’s parents divorced in 1959 and Stanford and his brother were raised by their mother, although he maintained a close relationship with his father and would later collaborate with him on business ventures.
Stanford graduated from Baylor University in Waco, Texas, in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in finance. He initially worked with his father in the insurance field, but was eager to find his own niche in a market that was somewhat flashier.
Standing 6-foot-4 with an athletic physique framed by college weightlifting, Stanford initially sought to harness the growing public interest in bodybuilding in the late 1970s by opening a gym in Waco, but that venture failed after a few years. He had more luck speculating in Houston’s real estate market, teaming with his father to acquire depressed properties when the local oil economy weakened in the early 1980s and later selling them at significantly higher prices to overseas investors when the market did an aggressive turnaround.
In the mid-1980s, Stanford relocated to Montserrat, an island in the British West Indies, with the goal of getting a toehold in the lucrative offshore banking sector. During the late 1960s and the 1970s, the U.K. government encouraged many of its territories to develop independent financial services industries — the initial goal was to make them less dependent on London for their fiscal needs.
But this policy had an unintended effect: these territories became havens for the world’s wealthiest people to safely squirrel their money away in tax havens. As a result, tiny locations including Guernsey and Jersey in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, and the Caribbean outposts of Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands and Montserrat gained popularity as offshore banking hotspots.
Stanford set up Guardian International Bank on Montserrat in 1985, attracting many of the overseas investors he worked with during his Houston real estate days. But Stanford soon found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. The U.K. government began to crack down on shady offshore banking activities in its overseas territories during the latter part of the 1980s, and Stanford became severely uncomfortable at having to answer to this new regulatory regimen.
Rather than head back to Texas, Stanford set his sights on Antigua and Barbuda, a tiny Caribbean nation that gained its independence from the U.K. in 1981. Without having to answer to London’s regulators, Stanford was welcomed by the small country’s government and quickly found himself with the opportunity to build his empire.
Caribbean King: When Stanford arrived in 1990, Antigua and Barbuda was not on anyone’s radar for massive investment and its economy was heavily dependent on tourism. And with a population of less than 100,000, large-scale opportunities were not feasible. But Stanford believed this unlikely location could become a choice destination for offshore banking.
Guardian International Bank, which changed its name to Stanford International Bank (SIB) in 1994, began focusing on attracting international investors to put money into its certificate of ...",2021-10-15T17:13:30Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/10/23382385/wall-street-crime-and-punishment-allen-stanfords-caribbean-ponzi-scheme-nightmare,0

"EXCLUSIVE: CoinFlip CEO Ben Weiss Seeks To Make Buying Crypto Easier It often seems that everyone is talking about cryptocurrency, but many people are still uncertain on how to become part of the digital action. And that’s where Chicago-based CoinFlip seeks to be of service.
Chicago-based CoinFlip operates the world's largest network of cryptocurrency ATMs by volume and an over-the-counter trading service. Ben Weiss, the company’s co-founder and CEO, recently spoke with Benzinga about his company’s work in bringing more people into the cryptocurrency sphere.
Q: For the benefit of people who are not familiar with your company, when did CoinFlip begin and why did it begin?
Weiss: CoinFlip began in 2015 when me and my co-founders were 20 years old. We believed in a decentralized economy, a decentralized financial system, and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and cryptocurrency. But we saw how difficult it was for those of us who are pretty good with technology to buy it.
And we thought, ‘If this is ever going to hit mass adoption, the average person has to be able to buy it. And not just the average person, but the person who's never sent an email should also have the ability to buy it as well.’ So, we wanted to make cryptocurrency as inclusive as possible for everyone.
Q: How does CoinFlip work?
Weiss: CoinFlip is a crypto-powered financial company and we can assist you in whatever way you want to buy Bitcoin. We take wire transfers, ACH and credit card, and we have physical kiosk locations in 49 states that we operate where anyone can go in with just a wallet and physical cash, scan their wallet and put in dollars and get their coin.

"Maximum Pain Trading Theory, Explained Trading options is a great way for investors to supplement their stock portfolio returns, hedge against unexpected market downturns or generate leverage for potential high-return trading ideas.
The options market can also be a useful source of information for stock traders.
One stock trading strategy revolves around the idea that high-powered option sellers will always look to push a stock’s share price toward an optimal price on option expiration dates.
Point Of Maximum Pain: Small retail option traders typically buy and sell a handful of option contracts at a time, but large institutional investment firms can generate returns by writing call and put option contracts and profiting from the premiums buyers pay. Option contract writers maximize their profits when the contracts they sell expire out-of-the-money, allowing them to keep 100% of the premiums they collected.
Call writers want an underlying stock’s price to fall below the contract’s strike price, while put writers want the stock’s price to rise above the contract’s strike price.

"Here's How Much Investing $1,000 In Camber Energy Stock One Year Ago World Be Worth Today Investors who have owned stocks in the last year have generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return over the last 12 months is 33.6%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way.
Camber’s Big Run: One company that has been a great investment in the last year has been oil and gas company Camber Energy Inc (NYSE: CEI).
Camber has been a spectacularly terrible long-term investment, losing 99.9% of its value in the past three years. However, a combination of improving energy market fundamentals and groups of online meme stock traders have brought the stock back to life in the past year.
Oil and natural gas prices recently both hit multi-year highs as booming global demand recovery has created energy supply shortages around the world, particularly in China.

"US GDP Up 2% In Q3: 'Very Disappointing' Investors got some disappointing news about the economic rebound Thursday when the U.S. Commerce Department reported third-quarter GDP growth that fell short of economist expectations.
What Happened? U.S. GDP grew just 2% in the third quarter, short of economist estimates of 2.8%. Third-quarter growth represented the slowest rate since the pandemic recovery began.

Why It’s Important: The third-quarter headline number may seem discouragingly low, but it gives investors a clearer picture of just how much of an impact supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and the delta variant of COVID-19 had on the economy in the third quarter.

"How Amazon Stock Looks Headed Into The Q3 Earnings Print Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) is set to print its third-quarter 2021 earnings after the closing bell Thursday. When the tech giant reported its second-quarter revenue miss on July 29, the stock gapped down 7% the following day, and the gap has yet to be filled. 
In terms of guidance for the third-quarter, Amazon projected third quarter revenues to come in between $106 billion to $112 billion, which would represent a 10% to 16% year-over-year increase. Wall Street analysts predict revenues will come in at the top of the range with a $111-billion consensus estimate.
Unlike many of its FAANG counterparts, Amazon has lagged the markets this year — rising just 4.5% since the beginning of January compared to the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY), which has soared about 21% higher.

"Wall Street Crime and Punishment: Christian Meissenn And His Penny Stock Pump-And-Dump Games Does crime pay?
Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction.
“Be careful who you let into your life,” declared a meme on Christian Meissenn’s Instagram page. “People will come and drain the s**t out of you…then leave and blame everything on you.”
Was Meissenn’s meme a cry of anguished warning against a world full of evil, or a self-tribute? After all, his claim to notoriety was ruining the lives of thousands of people who saw their money disappear into his warped fantasy world of promised penny stock glories.
The irony of that meme posting was that it happened at all. Meissen was able to play around on social media by making himself a victim of a greater injustice than the brutal scams he enacted on others.
The Strategy: On Nov. 8, 2016, Meissenn pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and one count of tax evasion in connection to his grand scheme. A plea of not guilty would have been ridiculous — not with the wealth of evidence stacked against him.
Starting in 2009, Meissenn and six accomplices (including two unscrupulous lawyers) orchestrated a seven-year pump-and-dump attack against vulnerable investors to buy shares in penny stock companies, which were mostly shell companies that fell under their control.
This gang unleashed an endless series of telephone calls and emails that bombarded the investors with grand promises of extraordinary returns on investments, while dishonest press releases went across the Internet with wild misrepresentations of the companies’ activities. The attorneys signed phony opinion letters offering false assurances to securities transfer agents and prospective investors that they reviewed corporate records and filings for the issuing companies and were satisfied with the adequacy of the companies’ public disclosures.
Meissenn and his gang gleefully reeled-in victims who naively sank money into the worthless stocks, bringing their prices to heights where they never belonged. When the prices reached inflated zeniths, the miscreants quickly cashed out and laughed over their gains while their investors were left with worthless stocks and no hope of recovering their losses. By the time the feds moved in during the summer of 2016, more than 12,000 investors collectively lost nearly $19 million.
Between 2011 and 2015, Meissenn accumulated roughly approximately $4.4 million from the scheme, but rather than deposit the money into his bank account he diverted most of his ill-gotten gains into an attorney’s trust account. The attorney was then directed to either wire funds or send checks to Meissenn — and none of this money was declared on his income taxes. When the Internal Revenue Service finally figured out what he pulled, Meissenn had tiptoed away from paying $1.5 million in federal income taxes.
A declaration of innocence in the face of this evidence was untenable, Meissenn realized, but cooperating with guilty pleas was not a happier solution. He faced up to 20 years behind bars for accepting guilt on the conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud charge and a maximum of five years for the tax evasion count.
But Meissenn had a curious talent for hitting a cosmic reset button that changed his situation when change was needed.
The American Adventure: Christian Meissenn only existed ...",2021-10-29T16:35:55Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/10/23699981/wall-street-crime-and-punishment-christian-meissenn-and-his-penny-stock-pump-and-dump-games,0

"What Can Help Canopy Growth Reach $250M In Sales? Analyst's Thoughts Ahead Of Earnings Canopy Growth Corporation (TSX: WEED) (NASDAQ: CGC) is scheduled to release its financial results for the second quarter fiscal year 2022 ended September 30, 2021, before financial markets open on November 5, 2021. 
On Wednesday, the Canadian cannabis giant announced the launch of two new product offerings from its Deep Space brand – Limon Splashdown and Deep Space XPRESS, while last week it confirmed the launch of a new CBD line - Harvest Medley CBD Wellness Gummies in partnership with Martha Stewart and Marquee Brands.
Year-to-date, the company’s stock fell 55.58%. 
The Analyst
Cantor Fitzgerald’s analyst Pablo Zuanic lowered the price target on Canopy’s stock to CA$18.50 ($14.90 ) from CA$21 keeping a ‘Neutral’ rating.
The Thesis
Canopy Growth previously issued guidance calling for a year-over-year sales decline despite the addition of Supreme Cannabis, the analyst noted.
To address reduced estimates and reflect sectoral deratings, Zuanic lowered the price target on Canopy’s stock.

Canopy’s Earnings

Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ: CGC), announced its financial results Friday for the second quarter fiscal 2022 ended September 30, revealing a 3% year-over-year decline in net revenue to CA$131 million ($105.4 million).

Total net cannabis revenue increased by 1% over the same period reaching CA$95 million in the second quarter of 2022.

The company also reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of CA$163 million for the same period, representing a CA$77 million wider loss versus the same period of last year, which can be attributed to lower sales, a decline in gross margins, partially offset by the reduction in total selling, general and administrative expenses.

Following the announcement, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Pablo Zuanic reiterated a ‘Neutral’ rating and the same price target of $CA18.50 on Canopy’s stock, concerned by the revenue and adjusted EBITDA misses, the double-digit decline in domestic business-to-business cannabis sales and ongoing share loss.

“We rate the stock Neutral, but we realize it is a bellwether stock, in a momentum sector, more sensitive than most to news ﬂow about federal changes in US regulation. We believe CEO David Klein has the backing of Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) (he was a well-regarded CFO there) and the Canopy Growth Board of Directors, so we do not expect disruption to the strategic plan he is implementing,” Zuanic concluded.

Big Banks Vs. Cannabis

Banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) may restrict the trading of certain U.S. cannabis-related stocks starting November 8.

According to Reuters, the company sent a letter to prime brokerage clients, citing compliance reasons: “J.P. Morgan (JPMS) has introduced a framework that is designed to comply with U.S. money laundering laws and regulations by restricting certain activities in the securities of U.S. Marijuana Related Businesses,"" the letter read.

It seems, however, the restriction will only apply to Over-The-Counter (OTC) traded stocks and limit new acquisitions and shorting of these equities. JPMorgan clients with pre-existing positions will be allowed to sell their shares at will.

Other than these exceptions, JP Morgan noted, cannabis-related businesses that are fully compliant with federal U.S. law, and can thus be listed on the Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchange will continue to be permitted to trade. These are non-plant-touching businesses operating in the U.S. and elsewhere, as well as companies working with the cannabis plant in federally legal settings, such as Canada.

Support For Legalization

The number of Americans who think that marijuana should be legally obtainable hit a record high for the second year in a row, according to a new Gallup survey released Thursday, which showed that as many as 68% of U.S. residents support cannabis legalization. The figure is the same as last year, which is the highest percentage of support ever revealed in a national Gallup poll.

Marijuana Research Bill For Veterans

With Veteran's Day just around the corner, a House committee passed legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct clinical trials into the therapeutic potential of marijuana for military veterans.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Lou Correa (D-Cal), was approved by the House Veterans Affairs Committee on Thursday in an 18-11 vote, with all Democrats in support and all but one Republican opposed. 

The earlier versions of the proposed legislation did not make it into law. Now, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act mandates that the department introduce a series of studies focusing on the use of medical marijuana in the treatment of PTSD and chronic pain.

De Klerk had announced in March that he had been diagnosed with mesothelioma.
A Political Scion: Frederik Willem de Klerk was born March 18, 1936, in a wealthy Johannesburg suburb.

Strijdom was the nation’s fifth prime minister.
De Klerk graduated from Potchefstroom University in 1958 with Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Law degrees and focused on a legal career. He was elected to the South African House of Assembly in 1972 as a member of the National Party and joined the cabinet of Prime Minister John Vorster in 1978 as Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions.

Analyst Reactions

Canopy Growth

Prior to last week's earnings release, Cantor Fitzgerald's analyst Pablo Zuanic lowered the price target on Canopy's stock to CA$18.50 to address reduced estimates and reflect sectoral deratings. The analyst kept a 'Neutral' rating and the same price target on the company's stock post-earnings release.

However, Zuanic additionally lowered the price target to CA$16.3 from CA$18.5 in hours following the market close, as the stock was down 13% intraday as of 3 pm on Friday.

Curaleaf

Zuanic maintained an overweight rating while lowering the price target on Curaleaf’s stock to $18.50 from $20, based on reduced margin estimates.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

Aurora Cannabis
Zuanic raised the price target on Aurora's stock to CA$10.75 from CA$9.60, after increasing sales estimates.

MedMen
Zuanic increased a price target on MedMen's stock to $0.26 from $0.25 while maintaining a Neutral rating.

Green Thumb

Zuanic reiterated an ‘Overweight’ rating on the stock and raised the price target to $54 from $38.

Acreage Holdings
Acreage became a more disciplined and focused operation, focused on “improving profit margins,” and “accelerating growth in Acreage’s core markets,” said Zuanic referring to changes that have occurred under Caldini’s management.

Cantor remains Neutral with no changes in their price target for ACRDF at $1.92 per share.

Columbia Care

Zuanic reiterated an ‘Overweight’ rating and price target of $5.20 on Columbia Care’s stock.

GOP Lawmakers Present Cannabis Legalization Bill

Finally, Republicans have released their marijuana legalization proposal!

"5 Recession Risk Factors That Investors Should Be Watching The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) has plenty of bullish momentum heading into the end of the year, and the latest jobs report from the Labor Department highlighted just how strongly the economy is rebounding now that COVID-19 vaccinations are widespread.
Yet economic recessions always catch investors off guard, so Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, regularly monitors a handful of recession risk factors to gauge U.S. economic risk.
Yield Curve & Valuation: The first risk factor McMillan is watching is the yield curve between 10-year Treasuries and three-month Treasuries. That yield curve steepened in October for the third consecutive month and has headed back toward historical norms, but McMillan said rising yields can also pose a threat to equity valuations.

GOP Legalization Bill

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) officially laid out her cannabis legalization plan on Monday. Titled the States Reform Act and co-sponsored by at least a half-dozen Republicans, the plan would essentially legalize cannabis on a federal level “in a manner consistent with the right of states to determine what level of cannabis reform or legalization each state wants to regulate, or not.”  

Highlights of the bill:


Federally decriminalizes cannabis and fully defers to state powers over prohibition and commercial regulation
Regulates cannabis products like alcohol products
Institutes a 3% federal excise tax on those products to fund law enforcement and small business programs.
Ensures the continued existence of state medical cannabis programs and patient access while allowing for new medical research and products to be developed
Protects our veterans by ensuring they will not be discriminated against in federal hiring for cannabis use or lose their VA healthcare for following their doctor’s advice to use medical cannabis
Protects children and young adults under 21 from cannabis products and advertising nationwide
Protects medical cannabis for the following uses: arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, sickle cell, HIV/AIDS, PTSD and other medical uses per a state’s specific cannabis regulations.


By comparison, the proposed legislation to legalize cannabis from democratic senators Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker and Ron Wyden would carry an excise tax of 25.5%, viewed as unreasonably high, especially for small businesses.



New Cannabis ETF

Poseidon Investment Management, one of the longest-running dedicated cannabis investment funds, launched the AdvisorShares Poseidon Dynamic Cannabis ETF (NYSE: PSDN).

It is sponsored by AdvisorShares and is sub-advised and managed by the Poseidon team, including co-founders and managing directors Emily Paxhia and Morgan Paxhia and managing director Tyler Greif.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

The fund seeks to identify companies strategically positioned to benefit from the cannabis industry and its supporting infrastructure in the U.S. as well as emerging global cannabis markets. PSDN's portfolio is diversified across subsectors of the cannabis industry and dynamically managed to tactically overweight or underweight specific countries, subsectors or individual companies. The new ETF may seek to take advantage of specific market opportunities by intelligently using leverage to maximize potential returns.

New York Bans Cannabis And Psychedelic Mushroom Ads On Public Transport

As New York continues to update on its cannabis-related rules and regs, an odd one seemed to slip into the books as the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) banned all cannabis and psychedelic mushroom ads on subways, buses and trains.

The advertising policy update comes after the MTA reached a settlement in a case related to a sexual wellness brand, Dame, which had been underway for the past three years. In that case, Dame will be permitted to advertise under certain restrictions, yet the MTA decided that weed and psychedelics are off-limits. 

Germany To Legalize Cannabis Sales

Germany might be the next country in Europe to legalize adult-use cannabis. This October, Luxembourg gave the green light to legal cannabis cultivation for personal use, and now Germany is about to decriminalize certain sale and consumption rules through an important drug policy change being undertaken by the ruling coalition government.

The political coalition, dubbed “traffic light” and comprised of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the Greens, is pushing to legalize cannabis sales.

“We are introducing the controlled distribution of cannabis to adults for recreational purposes in licensed shops,” a representative of the working group with an assignment to assess the policy change said, according to Der Spiegel, also citing a report by Funke.



Furthermore, the report reveals the policy, led by Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor-in-waiting, will be reexamined after four years to evaluate its social effects.

Powell served during the COVID-19 market crash in March 2020 and orchestrated the emergency interest rate cuts and implementation of $120 billion in monthly asset purchases to support the economy and provide liquidity to the financial markets during the subsequent economic shutdowns.

The casino industry was one of the hardest hit industries during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

"A Look At The S&P 500: Is Omicron To Blame For Recent Declines, Or Is It Just An Expected Pullback? It is natural to want to try and find meaning to price movement. After all, the more we think we know, the more we may be positioned to profit.
This logic tends to be counterintuitive when it comes to the financial markets.
In reality, the opposite is true with good investing, particularly as everyday people managing our own funds and portfolio. The less we try and understand why and the more focus on charts and follow the long-term trends, the more profit we are set to make.
One of the main reasons for this approach is that institutions pay a lot of money to get news items early. These new items have already been traded on and factored into the market by the time we hear them, so trying to make sense of it is often futile.
The bull trend in play since 2009 also confirms that all news items, including the declines around COVID-19 last year, are being absorbed into the long-term trend. Bullish is the only stance you want to have until the markets dictate otherwise.

"Has Ethereum Succumbed To Market Fear? Bears, Bulls Can Watch This Key Level Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) was falling over 10% lower at one point on Friday in sympathy with the general markets where the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) declined as much as 1.69% intraday following an abysmal jobs report.
Ethereum had been holding up strong in comparison to the stock market, rallying 18% between Saturday and Wednesday to reach a high of $4,784.50, which is just 1.74% below the Nov. 10 all-time high of $4.867.81. On Friday, possible market fear set in and began to drag the crypto down with it.
The pullback may be necessary to confirm a trend change, as long as Ethereum remains above a key level. If the level is lost, however, the crypto could be in for a much larger fall.

Isiah Thomas Appointed Executive Chairman Of One World Products' Board

One World Products (OTC: OWPC), a company formerly known as One World Pharma, which recently changed its name to ""One World Products: Sustainable Hemp and Cannabis Solutions,” will announce on Wednesday it has named Isiah Thomas as executive chairman of its board of directors.

Thomas will continue to serve in his role as CEO of the company, which is one of the largest Black-controlled licensed cannabis and hemp producers in the U.S. with offices in Las Vegas and operations in Colombia.

Tilray Accused Of Breaching License Agreement With IntelGenx

On the heels of Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ: TLRY) announcing that its medical subsidiary Aphria launched oral strips in THC and CBD-rich varieties, IntelGenx Corp. (TSX: IGX) (OTCQB: IGXT) revealed that it had initiated an arbitration proceeding against Tilray related to an alleged breach of the parties’ 2018 license, development and supply agreement, as amended with Tilray for the co-development and commercialization of cannabis-infused VersaFilm products.

IntelGenx, which is focused on the development and manufacturing of pharmaceutical films, noted that Tilray’s press release on the launch of the medical cannabis strips represented a material breach of the agreement.

 “We believe that this demonstrates a disregard of contractual obligations by Tilray,” Dr. Horst G. Zerbe, CEO of IntelGenx stated. ”We remain committed to protecting our commercial rights and are prepared to take any necessary legal steps in that regard. Making our innovative and high-quality oral thin film products available to medical and recreational cannabis consumers remains a top priority for IntelGenx.”

DEA Supports White House Plan To Streamline Research Of Psychedelics and Cannabis

While testifying at a recent House subcommittee hearing, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and National Institute On Drug Abuse (NIDA) signaled their willingness to align with a White House proposal that seeks to streamline the process of researching Schedule I drugs.

The federal government’s treatment of Schedule I drugs, which includes LSD, MDMA, cannabis and peyote, is defined by the DEA as having “no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse” has prevented many beneficial drugs from being readily obtained and studied by researchers.

Studies are showing that cannabis and a variety of psychedelic drugs are proving effective for treating a range of mental injuries, for instance, clinical studies of MDMA-assisted therapy to treat PTSD, which is currently in Phase III trials with the FDA.

Marijuana Moment reported that the DEA has said in written testimony that “expanding access to Schedule I research is a critical part of the DEA’s mission to protect public safety and health.”

The proposal looks to align research limitations of Schedule I drugs with those of less-restricted Schedule II drugs, which include effective and widely prescribed drugs like hydrocodone, Adderall and Ritalin. Researchers and policymakers alike have pointed out that existing protocols for studying Schedule I substances have for decades restricted essential research of therapies that could save lives.

"Michael Nesmith, Monkees Singer-Songwriter And Music Video Pioneer, Dies At 78 Singer-songwriter Michael Nesmith, who shot to fame in the mid-1960s as a member of the Monkees and would later inspire the rise of the 1980s music video era, died Friday at the age of 78 from natural causes.
An Unlikely Star: Nesmith was born in Houston on December 30, 1942. His parents divorced when he was four and his mother, Bette Nesmith, took several temporary jobs to support herself and her son. While working as an executive secretary at a bank, she invented a typewriter correction fluid that she patented and marketed as Liquid Paper.
She became of the most prominent women entrepreneurs of the 1960s and 1970s before selling her Liquid Paper Corporation to Gillette in 1979 for $48 million. Nesmith's mother died shortly afterward and he inherited her fortune, which would later enable him to finance multiple business initiatives.
Nesmith dropped out of high school to enlist in the Air Force in 1960, and received his GED by the time has discharged in 1962. He relocated to Los Angeles to seek a music career, briefly going by the name Michael Blessed.
Nesmith successfully auditioned in 1965 for “The Monkees,” a sitcom about a struggling rock band. During the audition, he offered a nonchalant attitude that was different from the other humble actors seeking a role — at one point, his plopped his feet on the producer’s desk — and he made an eccentric fashion statement by wearing a green wool hat to the audition to keep his hair out of his eyes. The headwear became his character’s trademark.
Nesmith was paired with British theater performer Davy Jones, folk music singer-songwriter Peter Tork and former child actor Micky Dolenz as the Monkees. While the four performers possessed music abilities, they were not permitted by music producer Don Kirshner to play the instruments on the early records released under the Monkees brand.
“The Monkees” quickly became a popular television show, mixing zany slapstick with musical interludes. Nesmith penned several of the songs featured on the ...",2021-12-10T21:10:14Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/12/24553496/michael-nesmith-monkees-singer-songwriter-and-music-video-pioneer-dies-at-78,0

"10 Weirdest Christmas Films Of All Time Are you growing tired of those syrupy Hallmark romantic flicks where plastic-pretty people find love amid the Christmas decorations? Are you bored of George Bailey and that bumbling angel? And has the tradition of Ralphie and his BB gun finally worn out its welcome?
Do not fear, beleaguered reader, for there is a parallel universe of bizarre, inane and frequently incomprehensible films that steamroll over the holiday spirit with blitheful recklessness. For those eager to pursue the stranger side of the yuletide season, here are the 10 weirdest Christmas movies of all time.
""Bikini Bloodbath Christmas"" (2010): The third installment in the horror-comedy ""Bikini Bloodbath"" series finds the gourmet-inspired serial killer Chef Death resurrected from his grave to provide a holiday season bloodbath while a battalion of buxom beauties occupy the title's promised bikinis. Scream queens Debbie Rochon, Rachael Robbins and Monique Dupree decorate the proceedings and there is also an out-of-left-field homage to ""Krull"" plus Troma chieftain Lloyd Kaufman turns up as a lascivious surgeon. (Disclosure: this article's author is also in the film.)

""A Flintstones Christmas Carol"" (1994): Okay, how can the denizens of prehistoric Bedrock celebrate a holiday inspired by the birth of Jesus? They could if you subscribe to the admittedly fringe opinion that the Flintstones did not reside in the past, but dwelled in a post-apocalyptic future created when the nuclear arms race bombed mankind into a new Stone Age. If that is correct, then feel free to blame Edward Teller and J. Robert Oppenheimer for this zillionth version of the Charles Dickens ghost story.

""The Lady in the Lake"" (1947): Film noir and Christmas rarely mix, but Robert Montgomery's adaptation of the Raymond Chandler mystery finds tough-guy private eye Philip Marlowe (played by Montgomery) investigating a disappearance of a publisher's wife.

"How The SPY Looks Heading Into Federal Reserve's Decision On Bond-Buying Taper The SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) has been shaky since Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell spoke before the U.S. Senate’s banking committee on Nov. 30 and spooked the markets by signaling the Fed’s policy may shift toward accelerating the taper of monthly asset purchases.
At 2 p.m. EST Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its policy meeting and investors are also waiting to hear whether the Fed plans to hike interest rates sooner to combat escalating inflation.
The markets may have already priced in a sped-up reduction of monthly bond purchases, which could lead to rate hikes coming sooner than previously anticipated because over the four trading days following Powell’s comments the SPY pulled back about 2.8% before bouncing back up toward its all-time high.

Pfizer Getting Into Cannabis

Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) is entering the cannabis space via the $6.7 billion acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARNA). The two publicly-traded companies confirmed Monday that they have signed a definitive agreement under which Pfizer will acquire all outstanding shares of Arena for $100 per share in an all-cash transaction.

Pfizer expects to finance the transaction with existing cash on hand upon obtaining all necessary approvals. 

“The proposed acquisition of Arena complements our capabilities and expertise in Inflammation and Immunology, a Pfizer innovation engine developing potential therapies for patients with debilitating immuno-inflammatory diseases with a need for more effective treatment options,” stated Mike Gladstone, global president & general manager, Pfizer Inflammation and Immunology. “Utilizing Pfizer’s leading research and global development capabilities, we plan to accelerate the clinical development of etrasimod for patients with immuno-inflammatory diseases.” Etrasimod is Arena's drug candidate for the treatment of immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases.

This is not the first time one of the largest pharmaceuticals companies in the world has obtained an interest in a cannabis-related company. Other big players with ties to the cannabis industry include Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ), Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ).

Visa vs. Cannabis Retailers

The burgeoning recreational marijuana industry – illegal at the federal level yet legal for adults in some 18 U.S. states and DC – has faced multiple challenges throughout the years, mostly because of the Schedule 1 status of the cannabis plant.  

The biggest problem? Banking, of course. 

As in life, retailers have had to find a way to work around the system. Some cannabis merchants have begun using cashless ATMs to bypass limitations on the types of sales payment cards they can legally accept. 

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

One of the largest payment processors in the world, Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) recently issued a compliance memo to customers warning them that incorrectly coding point-of-sale transactions via cashless ATMs could be penalized or punished by unspecified enforcement procedure.

Visa’s memo from Dec. 2 obtained by Marijuana Moment revealed that the company is “aware of a scheme” in which retailers are utilizing cashless ATMs to avoid limitations on the types of sales for which payment cards are allowed to be used.

“Cashless ATMs are POS devices driven by payment applications that mimic standalone ATMs. However, no cash disbursements are made to cardholders,” the memo clarified. “Instead, the devices are used for purchase transactions, which are miscoded as ATM cash disbursements. Purchase amounts are often rounded up to create the appearance of a cash disbursement.”

Although the Visa directive does not specifically mention cannabis, it highlights that cashless ATMs (also called reverse ATMs) “are primarily marketed to merchant types that are unable to obtain payment services—whether due to the Visa Rules, the rules of other networks, or legal or regulatory prohibitions,” a category that covers marijuana businesses.

Malta's Parliament Says Yes To Cannabis

Malta is poised to become the first country in Europe to legalize the cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal use.

The first country? What about the Netherlands?

While the Netherlands, and especially Amsterdam, is most commonly associated with cannabis consumption in Europe, marijuana possession and trade are technically illegal there although the Dutch government's relaxed attitude is well-known.

Proposed Rules In Malta

Under Malta's proposed bill, possession of up to 7g of cannabis, home cultivation of up to four plants and storing up to 50g of dried marijuana will be legally permitted for those aged 18 and above. Those found in possession of up to 28 grams, on the other hand, will be obliged to pay a €50-€100 fine but will not be subjected to a criminal record.

Owen Bonnici, the minister responsible for the program, told the Guardian that the Maltese government does not want to encourage the use of drugs, but that there’s no scientific proof that marijuana usage leads to abuse of more dangerous substances.

“There is a wave of understanding now that the hard-fist approach against cannabis users was disproportionate, unjust and it was rendering a lot of suffering to people who are leading exemplary lives,” Bonnici said. “But the fact that ...",2021-12-17T21:15:35Z,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/12/24680963/the-week-in-cannabis-pfizer-visa-730m-in-financings-malta-eu-columbia-care-medmen-uruguay-and-mo,0

"Desmond Tutu, Nobel Prize-Winning Theologian Who Advocated Against Apartheid, Dies At 90 Desmond Tutu, the South African theologian who brought both a spiritual and economic dimension to the struggle against his nation’s racist apartheid policies, passed away at the age of 90.
A Rise To Authority: Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born on Oct. 7, 1931 in Klerksdorp in northwest South Africa. He was baptized in the Methodist faith, although during his childhood his family changed denominations to the African Methodist Episcopal faith and then to the Anglican faith.
Tutu initially considered a career in medicine, but his family was unable to afford the tuition needed for medical training. He worked as a teacher before deciding on a ministry career. He entered St. Peter’s Theological College in Rosetenville and was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1961.
In 1967, he became chaplain at the University of Fort Hare. In 1975, Tutu made history as the first Black man to be named dean of St. Mary’s Cathedral in Johannesburg, which many viewed as the Anglican Church’s first major pushback at the racial separation tenets of the apartheid era.

Unfortunately, Inovio investors were thrown a curveball in September 2020 when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration placed a partial hold on the company’s phase 2 and 3 trials of Inovio’s INO-4800 vaccine candidate. At the time, the FDA had concerns about the trial and the device used to administer the vaccine to patients.

"8 Trading Themes To Watch In 2022 The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) is on track to finish an unpredictable 2021 near record highs after a third consecutive year of 16%-plus gains for the market. But with inflation concerns lingering and uncertainty surrounding the ongoing pandemic, there are plenty of reasons for investors to be concerned about stretched stock market valuations heading into 2022.
Here are eight market themes traders should look for in 2022.
1. Diversification And Defense
Investors looking to protect their portfolios against an uncertain environment may try to diversify outside of the tech-heavy growth stocks that have performed so well since the early 2020 market crash.
“Static allocations to passive exposures in fixed income and equities are not advisable in this environment while expanding your portfolio toolkit to include inflation-sensitive assets such as commodities and property are recommended, given their inflation linkages,” Kej Somaia, co-head of Multi-Asset Solutions, recently said. In recent months, Multi-Asset Solutions has been reducing its exposure to growth stocks and bonds.
2. U.S. Stock Weakness
U.S. stocks have significantly outperformed international stocks in recent years, but Morgan Stanley Chief Cross-Asset Strategist Andrew Sheets recently said there’s a chance the S&P 500 could finish 2022 lower for the year and underperform international markets.

"Harry Reid, Controversial Senate Majority Leader, Dies At 82 Harry Reid, who brought both legislative results and repeated controversy to his eight-year tenure as U.S. Senate Majority Leader, passed away at the age of 82 from pancreatic cancer.
A Rise To Prominence: Harry Mason Reid Jr. was born on Dec. 2, 1939, in Searchlight, Nevada. His father worked as a rock miner and his mother was a laundress for local brothels.
Reid graduated from Utah State University in 1961 with a double major in political science and history. He moved to Washington, D.C., to attend George Washington University Law School and supported himself as an officer in the U.S. Capitol Police until he completed his studies in 1964.
Reid returned to Nevada to practice law. He became involved in Democratic Party politics, gaining election as city attorney in Henderson and later as an assemblyman in the state’s legislature. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1970 and served one term before embarking on an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 1974 and a doomed race for Las Vegas mayor in 1975.
Reid stayed in the public eye as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1977 to 1981. He was elected the U.S. House of Representatives from Nevada’s 2nd Congressional District in 1982 and was re-elected two years later. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1987 and served in that chamber for the next 30 years.

"Betty White, Iconic Actress, Dies At 99 Betty White, the beloved comic actress who career spanned the history of television, died Friday at the age of 99.
Early Years: Betty Marion White was born in Oak Park, Illinois, on Jan. 17, 1922. Her family relocated to California when she was 1, and she made her show business debut at the age of 8 on a radio show called “Empire Builders.”
In 1939, the 17-year-old White had her first small screen appearance in an experimental television broadcast from Los Angeles that included her singing songs from “The Merry Widow.”
White sought a career in modeling and acting, but when World War II began she enlisted in the American Women's Voluntary Services, with assignments that included transporting military supplies in California. After the war, she tried unsuccessfully to break into films, but had more success in radio and by 1949 she hosted her own program.
Early TV Stardom: In 1949, White had her first big break in the nascent television medium as co-host of the daily “Hollywood on Television.” After her co-host Al Jarvis departed the show, White took on the solo hosting duties.
In 1952, White co-founded a production company that created “Life With Elizabeth,” a syndicated sitcom that ran for three years; she was the first woman producer ...",2021-12-31T20:59:32Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/12/24850930/betty-white-iconic-actress-dies-at-99,0

"Marking The 80th Anniversary Of 'Hemp For Victory,' The Government's Censored Cannabis Film Eighty years ago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directed American farmers to bypass a federal law prohibiting the harvest of hemp. This unusual policy was enacted out of desperation – after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Japanese cut off the Asian supply of rope fiber exports to the U.S. Since these exports were needed to provide cordage for the U.S. naval fleet, the government needed an alternative commodity to fill that void.
Except that there was a problem – the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act made hemp farming illegal. Never mind that hemp lacked the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) necessary to create the narcotic effect of marijuana – the feds insisted hemp and marijuana looked so much alike that it was difficult to enforce the nation’s drug laws. Thus, a once-lucrative non-criminal cash crop was removed from the soil.
But thanks to Tojo and friends, the USDA did an about-face – or, more accurately, an end-run around the Marihuana Tax Act, which was not voided or amended. As a wartime emergency effort, the USDA ignored the law and sought to gather as much industrial hemp as possible. But this created another problem – many farmers never grew hemp and had little idea how to generate a bumper crop.
The solution was a short documentary produced by the USDA called “Hemp for Victory.”

On The Big Screen: “Hemp for Victory” was designed as a crash-course for farmers in how to cultivate this crop. The film opens with a thumbnail history of hemp, noting its ancient roots as a source of cordage and clothing in China and across Asia.
“For centuries prior to about 1850, all the ships that sailed the western seas were rigged with hempen rope and sails,” said the film’s narrator, adding that the USS ...",2022-01-01T14:18:12Z,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/01/24843956/marking-the-80th-anniversary-of-hemp-for-victory-the-governments-censored-cannabis-film,0

"Apple, Carnival, JPMorgan Stocks Provide Entry Point For Bullish Traders: How To Play It Apple, Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Carnival Corp (NYSE: CCL) and JP Morgan & Chase (NYSE: JPM) are all trading higher in strong uptrends. An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart.
The higher highs indicate the bulls are in control while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend with rising lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend and rising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicating a long-term uptrend.
A stock often signals when the higher high is in by printing a reversal candlestick such as a doji, bearish engulfing or hanging man candlestick. Likewise, the higher low could be signaled when a doji, morning star or hammer candlestick is printed. Moreover, the higher highs and higher lows often take place at ...",2022-01-05T22:18:41Z,https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/technicals/22/01/24914763/apple-carnival-jpmorgan-stocks-provide-entry-point-for-bullish-traders-how-to-play-it,0

The producer price index (PPI) measures the fluctuation in selling prices received by domestic producers. The CPI is focused on the prices consumers pay, while the PPI is focused on the costs of the industries that make the products.

Tilray’s Earnings And Reactions

Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ: TLRY) (TSX: TLRY) reported its financial results Monday for the second fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2021, with net revenue of $155 million, up by around 20% from $129 million in the same period year ago and down from $168 million in the first fiscal quarter.

The Canadian marijuana giant also announced a new parent name, Tilray Brands, Inc., reflecting the company’s evolution from a Canadian LP to a global consumer packaged goods company with a portfolio of cannabis and lifestyle CPG brands.

Net income increased to $6 million from a net loss of $89 million in the previous year's quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.8 million, representing 8% growth compared to the preceding prior quarter and making for the eleventh consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA; Gross profit of $32.8 million was a 7% decrease from $35.3 million in the prior-year quarter.

Following the report, Benzinga spoke with CEO Irwin Simon.



Analyst Reaction

After the results, Pablo Zuanic from Cantor Fitzgerald offered an updated investment model for Tilray. He maintained an Overweight but lowered the price target for the stock to $6.90 from $7.40 on reduced estimates.

“We attach our updated model after talking to management and the release of the 10-Q for the Nov quarter. Conditions in the domestic Canadian recreational market remain challenging, with market share erosion and wholesale destocking leading to a 30% sequential drop in reported sales,” Zuanic noted.

The analyst also highlighted that even though the new estimates reflect less bullish market share assumptions, “the company is implementing several adjustments that should reverse the market share slide.”

Zuanic added that Cantor was still impressed with Tilray's growth.

“Maybe, more importantly, we were positively impressed with the company’s sequential growth in the export business (~40%), generating $7.8 million in sales. As European countries start to legalize cannabis in the next few years (Germany by late 2023?), we believe TLRY is well-placed given its production and distribution infrastructure and established brands (especially in med tinctures).” 

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

Later in the week, it was reported that Tilray ended its partnership with AB InBev (NYSE: BUD), quickly turning around to wrap up two previously announced deals to acquire Green Flash Brewing and Alpine Beer Co.

The Canadian cannabis giant purchased the California craft beer brands from WC IPA on Dec. 17, for $5.1 million (CA$6.4 million), in cash and stock, according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Cannabis And Covid

As scientists around the world work furiously for nearly the past two years in an attempt to resolve the ongoing global pandemic, new research on cannabis and COVID-19 is providing some hope.

Can cannabis help against the coronavirus?

According to a report, “Cannabinoids Block Cellular Entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the Emerging Variants,” published in the Journal of Natural Products, certain cannabinoid acids from hemp (Cannabis sativa) could prevent infection from the virus that causes COVID-19 by obstructing its entry into cells.

It should be noted this is very early data.

The study led by Richard van Breemen, a researcher with Oregon State's Global Hemp Innovation Center, College of Pharmacy and the Linus Pauling Institute discovered that two cannabinoid acids in hemp - cannabigerolic acid, or CBGA, and cannabidiolic acid, also known as CBDA have the ability to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein – the virus that causes COVID-19. By binding to the spike protein, these acids can block the virus from reaching into cells and causing infection, concluded the research.

“Orally bioavailable and with a long history of safe human use, these cannabinoids, isolated or in hemp extracts, have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2,” the researchers noted in the abstract of the study.

“These cannabinoid acids are abundant in hemp and in many hemp extracts,” van Breemen said, as quoted by local media. “They are not controlled substances like THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and have a good safety profile in humans.”",2022-01-14T20:38:17Z,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/01/25061787/the-week-in-cannabis-tilray-earnings-and-reactions-weed-and-covid-italy-marijuana-at-the-airport,0

"10 Weirdest Facts About Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: The Rat Pack, Grammy Nominations And An X-Rated Movie On Monday, Jan. 17, the U.S. observes the holiday honoring the life and achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. For many people, Dr. King is the iconic leader of the civil rights movement who brilliantly articulated the aspirations of Black Americans to be treated as full-class citizens in their country.
Yet, there are many aspects to Dr. King’s life that might not be familiar to many people. And, indeed, some of these aspects might come as a surprise. To celebrate the unexpected side of his life, here are the 10 weirdest facts in the life of Dr. King.
What’s In A Name: Before he was Martin Luther King Jr., he was born Michael King Jr. in 1929. His father, Michael King Sr., was the pastor of Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, and in 1934 the elder King attended the Baptist World Alliance conference in the German capital of Berlin. While there, he decided to rename himself in honor of Martin Luther, the German monk who launched the Reformation.
Not only did the elder King legally change his name, but he also renamed his son. However, Dr. King did not revise his birth certificate with his new name until 1957, when he was 28 years old.

A First Taste Of Freedom: For his first 15 years, Dr. King grew up in the Jim Crow South and was witness to daily hardships suffered by the Black population.
In the summer of 1944, the 15-year-old King left the South for the first time and headed north to earn money by taking a summer job picking tobacco on a farm in Connecticut. For the young man, the experience was overwhelming – in his letters home, he marveled at being able to attend an integrated church, dine in an integrated restaurant and use public facilities that were not restricted by race.
“After that summer in Connecticut,” he later recalled, “it was a bitter feeling going back to segregation.”

Dr. King And The Rat Pack: In the early 1960s, Dr. King’s leadership position with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) made him a nationally prominent figure – and even Frank Sinatra was impressed with Dr. King’s mission of using nonviolence to dismember state-sanctioned segregation.
On Jan. 27, 1961, Sinatra brought his Rat Pack pals Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. to New York City’s Carnegie Hall for a fundraising benefit on behalf of the SCLC. Tony Bennett, Harry Belafonte, Buddy Hackett, Mahalia Jackson and Jan Murray also performed in an event billed as a “Tribute to Martin Luther King Jr.” The audience at the 2,760-seat Carnegie Hall were treated to a show running an astonishing four hours and 40 minutes, and the fundraiser aspect of the event hauled in more than $50,000, which is roughly $468,000 in today’s money.",2022-01-15T18:45:39Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/01/25049153/10-weirdest-facts-about-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-the-rat-pack-grammy-nominations-and-an-x-rated-movi,0

"EXCLUSIVE: LEX Offers A New Approach To Real Estate Investing With A $250 Entry Price New York City-based LEX Markets Corp. recently introduced a new platform for investors in commercial real estate by making available equity shares of individual commercial real estate assets. Investors would be able to trade these shares, without fees or required holding periods, on LEX’s fully-licensed securities platform.
The first property made available on the LEX platform was an office and retail property at 286 Lenox Avenue in New York’s Harlem neighborhood. The property was listed in early November, with shares available on LEX’s platform at an opening price of $250 per share. The goal of the initial offering was to raise $2.15 million in equity.
Benzinga recently spoke with Drew Sterrett, LEX’s co-CEO and co-founder, about this distinctive approach to real estate investing.
Q: When did you begin LEX, and why did you begin it?
Drew Sterrett: The idea formed in 2017 – when I was working at a real estate private equity firm, structuring private institutional real estate deals with minimum investments of a million-plus. I didn't have the ability to write a million-dollar check or participate in the types of deals I was structuring in any way, and I realized that both me and people like me were excluded from these investment opportunities because of investment minimums.
I also realized that real estate is one of the oldest and largest asset classes in the world, and one of the largest wealth creators, but there was no public and liquid market – it was one of those things that should have existed 60 years ago. The solution that I created with my co-founders Dean Sterrett and Jesse Daugherty to fix this gap was to create the first commercial real estate securities market.
Q: How does an investor get involved with LEX?

"Biden Vs. Trump: How Did Stock Market Returns Compare After Their First Year As President? It's been one year since U.S. President Joe Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021. Biden's first year in office has seen some successes and many bumps in the road, but investors are likely just fine with Biden's performance on Wall Street.
Biden's Popularity Slumping: Biden's big success of his first year was his $1 trillion infrastructure investment plan, which was signed into law back in November. The plan will put $550 billion of new federal investments into transportation, broadband internet and utility upgrades.
However, Biden has also been widely criticized for his reactive COVID-19 strategy, his lack of progress on the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better plan to invest in social programs and climate initiatives and his failure to secure the votes needed to pass a voting rights bill.

"US Indices Are At Support: Will Price Bounce Or Break Through? I have mentioned in my previous posts that being in tune with the seasonal movement of the market is essential as an investor. This has two main benefits:

Understanding when trends are likely, offering entry points and a time to act and build a portfolio.
It's about knowing when pullbacks are likely and being aware of when to stand aside and potentially look to buy in at pullbacks from solid support levels.

January/February and September are synonymous with pullbacks. This year has already delivered on that front. 
Whereas most will be panicking based on the noise in their media channels, good investors will remain objective, focus on the charts and already have a contingency plan in place that they are now executing. 
My bias overall still remains bullish. Let's have a look at the daily chart of each of the three major indices to understand why.

Senate Candidate Smokes A Blunt In Campaign Ad

Democrat Gary Chambers, who is seeking a U.S. Senate seat from Louisiana, released a campaign ad on Tuesday in which he smokes a sizable blunt while sitting in an armchair looking about as chill as someone could possibly look. But Chambers is dead serious about the harms of cannabis criminalization.

“Black people are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana laws than white people,” Chambers says quoting ACLU statistics. “States waste $3.7 billion enforcing marijuana laws every year. Most of the people police are arresting aren’t dealers, but rather people with small amounts of pot, just like me.”

The ad is titled “37 Seconds,” a reference to research finding that police make a marijuana-related arrest every 37 seconds on average.



“For too long, candidates have used the legalization of marijuana as an empty talking point in order to appeal to progressive voters,” Chambers said in a press release. “I hope this ad works to not only destigmatize the use of marijuana, but also forces a new conversation that creates the pathway to legalize this beneficial drug, and forgive those who were arrested due to outdated ideology.”

Silver Spike IPO

Silver Spike Investment Corp. announced a $125.02 million initial public offering. The New York-based company plans to go public with 8.93 million shares at $14.00 per share. SSIC is expected to list its common stock on the NASDAQ under the symbol “SSIC.”

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and Piper Sandler & Co. are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. Canaccord Genuity LLC and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. are acting as co-managers.

Fire & Flower Files For Nasdaq Listing

Fire & Flower Holdings Corp. (TSX: FAF) (OTCQX: FFLWF) announced the filing of its Form 40-F Registration Statement with the US  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in preparation for the company to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.

Biden Won't Keep His Cannabis Decriminalization Promise

“It is important to bear in mind that political campaigns are designed by the same people who sell toothpaste and cars,” Noam Chomsky once said.

Right on point, many would agree, considering that more than half of the U.S. adult population concurs that President Joe Biden has made little to no progress on his crucial campaign promise to decriminalize cannabis during his first year in office, according to a new poll conducted by YouGov and the Economist.

The survey revealed that the majority of U.S. residents also don’t hold out much hope that the president will make progress on this important reform in 2022.

As per the survey, 54% believe that Biden made little to no progress on marijuana decriminalization; 23% said they don’t know and another 23% think he made some or a lot of progress on the matter.

58% of respondents overall do not expect Biden to make progress on cannabis decriminalization in 2022, with 26% unsure what to expect and only 16% optimistically believing he’ll make some or a lot of progress on the issue.

It is important to note that 58% of respondents confirmed they support marijuana decriminalization and 25% do not.

New York: $1B In Marijuana Taxes

According to official projections, the state of New York could generate over a billion dollars in marijuana taxes before the end of the decade.

An estimate included in the governor’s executive budget calculated that between now and 2028, the state could gather more than $1.25 billion from licensing fees and other taxes.

The Empire State legalized adult-use marijuana in March of 2021, but cannabis shops are not expected to open until late 2022 or early 2023, as Newyorkers wait for the state to issue licenses to producers, distributors and retailers.

Marijuana-related tax collection is expected to increase on a yearly basis.

Both China-based electric vehicle manufacturers broke down from bearish head-and-shoulder patterns on Monday, but bulls came in and bought the dip when the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) bounced up from the $420 level. This caused Nio to print a hammer candlestick on the daily chart and Xpeng to form a dragonfly candlestick. Both candlesticks indicate that at least the temporary bottom may be in for the stocks.
It should be noted, however, that events affecting the general markets, negative or positive reactions to earnings reports and news headlines about a stock can quickly invalidate patterns and breakouts. As the saying goes, ""the trend is your friend until it isn't"" and any trader in a position should have a clear stop in place and manage their risk versus reward.

Amazon Supports GOP's Legalization Bill

The big news item this week related to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which announced its support for a Republican-backed congressional bill that would legalize cannabis at the federal level and allow states to decide how and whether to ban or regulate it. 

Congresswoman Nancy Mace's (R-SC) State Reform Act, released in November, would remove cannabis as a Federal Schedule I substance and introduce a 3% federal tax on it. As it was the first bill issued by the Republicans, it created quite a stir at the time.

Now, Amazon, which already supported cannabis legalization, has expressed support for the GOP bill.

In a tweet on Tuesday, Amazon’s public policy department said, “We’re pleased to endorse @RepNancyMace’s States Reform Act. Like so many in this country, we believe it’s time to reform the nation’s cannabis policy and Amazon is committed to helping lead the effort.” 

Mace said Amazon was likely motivated to approve her bill because legal issues with marijuana could make hiring difficult. 

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

“They see it from a worker’s point of view,” Mace said, according to Forbes. “The ban at the federal level actually affects their workforce.” 

New York Relaxes Medical Rules

The New York State Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) announced on Monday the launch of a new medical cannabis certification and registration system that will not only be far easier to use but will expand eligibility criteria for patients who can benefit from medical cannabis.

The program, the first of its kind nationally, will allow the certification of a patient by a practitioner for any condition that the practitioner believes can be treated with medical cannabis, reported local CBS News outlet WRBG Albany. A precedent can be found in Argentina's REPROCANN program.

Practitioner's discretion in certifying patients was essentially granted with the passage of the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act (MRTA), which legalized cannabis last March. 

Recommended read: [Chart] Cannabis Stocks: Is There Any Port In This Storm?

The new certification and registration system brings the system under the full control of the state's OCM and continues the work of expanding the program, pursuant to the MRTA.

Interest rates are at record lows and stock prices are at record highs. So what should you do with your extra cash?

Since most of these accounts are insured by the FDIC, they are about the safest place you can put extra cash. However, if you’re looking to use your extra money to earn income, the interest rates on savings accounts is typically well below 1.0 percent, which is extremely low.

House of Reps Approves Marijuana Banking Bill

The U.S. House of Representatives formally attached a marijuana banking reform amendment to a large-scale bill dealing with innovation and manufacturing, marking the most recent development in the push to protect financial institutions that work with state-legal cannabis businesses.

Marijuana Moment first reported that the amendment from sponsor Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) was preliminarily approved on Wednesday on a voice vote as part of an 'en bloc group' with other amendments, but a roll call was requested. The chamber then took that package back up on Thursday and passed it in a 262-168 vote.

“There was no floor debate about the cannabis provision itself, demonstrating how relatively noncontroversial the bipartisan-supported reform is in the House,” noted Marijuana Moment's Kyle Jaeger. “The Senate, as observers of the issue know, is a different story.”

Advocates will need to wait and see whether the America COMPETES Act, with the now-attached Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, will actually pass in the House on Friday when a final vote is expected. 

Marijuana legalization proponents have been pushing for the SAFE Banking Act to be passed into law for several years. 

Though legislative hurdles have arisen in the past, it appears as though there may be momentum for meaningful change. The hope is that bicameral negotiations do not remove the desired language from the currently proposed legislation, ultimately setting the stage for its enactment.  


Biden's Commerce: No Decriminalization Updates On Her Agenda

President Joe Biden’s Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo revealed in a recent interview with Politico that she has no updates on cannabis decriminalization that was promised during the presidential campaign.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

When a reporter asked if cannabis should be descheduled, pointing out that some businesses don’t want to see this as it would likely increase competition creating across state markets, Raimondo replied that the matter is “so far afield from anything that I’m working on.” As Raimondo’s focus continues to be trade and supply chain management, marijuana is apparently not yet on her agenda.

Just recently, a new poll conducted by YouGov and The Economist, revealed that more than half of the U.S. adult population concurs that President Biden has made little to no progress on his crucial campaign promise to decriminalize cannabis during his first year in office.

Mississippi Legalizes Medical Marijuana

Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation late Wednesday making Mississippi the 37th state to legalize medical marijuana. The law goes into effect immediately. 

""There is no doubt that there are individuals in our state who could do significantly better if they had access to medically prescribed doses of cannabis,"" Reeves said in a statement after signing the bill, reported local media outlets. 

Senate Bill 2095, the Mississippi Medical Cannabis Act, will regulate the production and distribution of cannabis flowers and concentrates to patients with ""debilitating medical conditions"" such as cancer, refractory pain, post-traumatic stress, spinal cord disease and other qualifying ailments.

The law also sets taxes on the production and sale of cannabis and specifies that plants must be grown indoors under controlled conditions.

For those with a taste for the warped, here are the 10 weirdest Academy Award achievements since the first Oscars were handed out in 1929.
An Oscar In Less Than Three Minutes: The shortest film to win an Academy Award was “The Crunch Bird,” a 2-minute 20-second production by Detroit cartoonists Joe Petrovich and Ted Petok that won the Best Animated Short Subject Award for 1971. Petrovich and Petok submitted their work for Oscar consideration on a dare, never dreaming that such a micro-movie would gain the grand prize.

But “The Crunch Bird” was not the shortest film ever to be Oscar nominated – the 1-minute 41-second “Fresh Guacamole” from the animator PES was up for the 2012 Best Animated Short Subject prize.

Blink And You Miss An Oscar Nominee: Oscar trivia buffs know that Beatrice Straight’s 5-minute 2-second performance in “Network” (1976) was the shortest performance to win an Academy Award, but her screen time seemed epic compared to the work of Hermione Baddeley in the 1959 “Room at the Top.” Although Baddeley was only given 2 minutes and 19 seconds of screen time across three brief scenes, it was enough to earn her a Best Supporting Actress nomination, making her appearance the briefest to gain Academy notice.

The Ultimate Upset Winner: Few people expected Hal Mohr to win the 1935 Best Cinematography Oscar for “A Midsummer’s Night Dream” – if only because he wasn’t nominated. In the mid-1930s, the Academy changed its rules to allow write-in votes to go alongside the ballot nominees, but after ...",2022-02-05T18:45:00Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/02/25434330/10-weirdest-academy-award-achievements-of-all-time,0
"If You Invested $1,000 In Airline Stocks When Buffett Sold, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Wall Street legend and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett took some investors by surprise in April 2020 when he sold Berkshire’s entire stakes in Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL), American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL), United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV) near their lowest points of the COVID-19 market sell-off.
Buffett famously said investors should be “fearful when others are greedy” and “greedy only when others are fearful.” Nearly two years after Buffett dumped his airline stocks, investors that were greedy when Buffett himself was fearful have been rewarded by the market.

"10 Most Searched Tickers On Benzinga In January: SPY, Tesla, Apple And More Each trading day features hundreds of headlines and press releases about companies. Benzinga Pro is a source for traders to see the latest news on the overall market and also on individual tickers.
Here is a look at the stocks that were searched for the most on Benzinga Pro for the month of January.
1. SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY)

YTD Return: -4.6%
52-Week Range: $379.37 to $479.98
Price: $453.92

The S&P 500 themed ETF was the most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro for the month of January. The ETF was the eighth most searched ticker in 2021 across Benzinga Pro.

2. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)

The most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro in all of 2021 comes in second place to start 2022. The electric vehicle giant had nearly as many searches as SPY in January, but came up just short. Tesla reported quarterly earnings in January, which likely helped with continued interest in the stock.

"Tesla Stock Attempts To Lift Market, Gets Shot Down Despite Bitcoin Rebound Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) attempted to lead the broader market higher on Monday morning, popping up about 2.65% higher, but lost steam when the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) was unable to break up over Friday’s high-of-day, making an inside bar on the broad sector ETF the most likely scenario.

Benzinga: What is the overall state of the commercial real estate market today?
Mike Flood: I would say the overall status is very positive — there is plenty of liquidity in the marketplace and, outside of trying to work through obvious challenges with retail and hotel, marketplaces are good. You have lenders with good liquidity who managed their portfolios well throughout the crisis.
Multifamily is clearly doing well, and so is industrial. Projections for the year continue to increase in nearly every space. This is looking to be one of the leaders coming out of the recovery.

Schumer Urges Senators To Help Finalize Marijuana Legalization Bill

Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) asked senators to help them complete the marijuana legalization bill expected to be filed in April. To that end, the top Senate Democrats sent letters to their colleagues encouraging them to get into the drafting process and help finalize this legislation.

The letter comes nearly a week after Schumer told a press conference in New York City, that in April he plans to officially file the long-awaited bill to federally legalize cannabis.

“In the coming weeks, we’re ramping up our outreach—and we expect to introduce final legislation. Our goal is to do it in April,” Schumer said. “Then we begin the nationwide push, spearheaded by New York, to get the federal law done. As majority leader, I can set priorities. This is a priority for me.”

It’s been around six months since Schumer unveiled details of the bill.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

“Right now, we’re taking those comments [on the draft version] and reaching out to Democratic and Republican senators,” said Schumer, adding that “we have some Republican support.”

It was not clear if Schumer was referring to having GOP cosponsors of the legislation or general support from voters.

No Weed At The Super Bowl

Super Bowl ads…ever more creative, sophisticated and humorous. In recent years, some newcomers have gotten in on the fun: hard liquor and sports betting apps. This year’s newbie on the screen: cryptocurrencies.

Yes, Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA)'s NBC is allowing crypto, but not cannabis ads, to air during Sunday’s game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals.

So, all of this begs a question: why is cannabis once again shut out of the Super Bowl? NBC’s placement of cannabis in the “restricted” category does not quite cut it as an explanation.

This is the third year that cannabis has been rejected from showing its face in the biggest advertising event of the year, though it persists. In 2019, Acreage Holdings (OTCQX: ACRDF) tried to place a heart-wrenching yet informative ad about cannabis’ medical benefits in treating children with epilepsy, adults with depression and military veterans with PTSD. No go, NBC said.

When California-based Weedmaps (NASDAQ: MAPS), or WM Technology, broached the subject with NBC about placing an ad in the LVI Super Bowl, the response ""was a blanket ‘no,’” Juanjo Feijoo, Weedmaps COO told Inverse.

The 14th Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference, the world’s biggest and most successful cannabis investing and finance event, will take place on April 20 and April 21, 2022, at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel, in Miami, Florida. Enjoy exclusive opportunities for curated networking and unparalleled access to private deal flow, hear directly from the executives of top-performing cannabis companies and get priceless insights from the world’s leading cannabis investors, all in one place.

But, to prove an important point, Weedmaps made a humorous yet poignant digital ad for the Super Bowl anyway, starring a life-sized broccoli sprout - a symbol for cannabis - who is tired of being mistaken for something he’s not.

Mixed Messages

Also this week, Tavarres King, a former Georgia Bulldog and NFL player told Atlanta's Channel 2 sports director Zach Klein that 80% of the players in the league are using cannabis.

And finally, the NFL announced it is giving UC San Diego $500,000 to study if cannabis can be used to help athletes manage pain from injuries and recover more quickly.

The NFL awarded the contract to UCSD’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, to conduct a study on professional Rugby players partly because cannabis is a banned substance in the NFL. Rugby is ...",2022-02-11T18:44:29Z,https://www.benzinga.com/node/25574267,0
"Why Apple Stock Could Be A Treat For The Bears If History Repeats Apple, Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) was trading mostly flat on Friday, in line with the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY), which was consolidating Thursday’s afternoon sell-off with an inside bar pattern on the daily chart.
On Thursday, the tech giant said it is working to issue updates to its AirTag tracking software to stop users misusing the technology to track or spy on people and that it was working with law enforcement on AirTag-related requests.

"10 Weirdest Love Songs Of All Time: Beatles, Bugs Bunny And A Cake Left Out In The Rain Every couple has a certain love song that they claim as their own. And with Valentine’s Day approaching, these songs probably get a greater level of play.
But there are also love songs that no one is touching, except to make a list of the 10 weirdest love songs of all time. And, lo and behold, here is such a list for your listening torture:
“Aicha”: This 1996 Algerian pop song had the unlikeliest cover in 2002 when a scrawny Belgian teenager calling himself Gellieman recorded an English-language version in a deadpan manner, complete with a brilliantly awkward dance movement.
The video was a minor viral hit when it first went online. Gellieman’s whereabouts today are a mystery, yet Internet opinion on the song remains divided, with some people insisting Gellieman was creating a sly comedy work and others insisting that he was unaware of his ineptitude. But perhaps a Reddit commentator had the best observation regarding the audacity of the effort: “This guy has platinum balls.”

“Losing You”: Chicago-based Jan Terri brought more enthusiasm than talent to her music, and a combination of inadequate vocalizing and unsatisfactory songwriting doomed her efforts to secure pop music stardom. However, her outsider vibe was strong enough to briefly pique the interest of Marilyn Manson – he recruited her as the opening act for his concerts in Chicago in 1998 and 1999, and she joined him in the 1999 video “God Is In The TV.”
In case you’re wondering why there is a surplus amount of limousine footage in this video, that’s because Terri worked as a limousine driver when she wasn’t recording sincere but wobbly love songs.

“Love Will Keep Us Together”: Neil Sedaka co-wrote and recorded this tune in 1973, but a 1975 cover by Captain & Tennille made it a global favorite. And while there is nothing wrong with the song on its own terms, there is a lot wrong with the most infamous cover version involving Mae West and Timothy Dalton in the 1978 movie “Sextette.”
West was 84 when the film was shot and Dalton was 30 – they were supposed to play newlyweds, but Dalton can barely keep a straight face while singing how his octogenarian bride is “young and beautiful” while West seems to be in ...",2022-02-12T18:46:55Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/02/25556404/10-weirdest-love-songs-of-all-time-beatles-bugs-bunny-and-a-cake-left-out-in-the-rain,0

"What's Going On With Coinbase's Stock Following Viral Super Bowl Promo? Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) was trading about 2% higher on Monday morning after its Super Bowl ad, which featured a QR code linked to its “Less Talk, More Bitcoin” promotion and sign-up page, went viral and temporarily crashed its site.
Coinbase Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee said on Twitter shortly after the crash that Coinbase had experienced the highest-ever traffic on its website with more than 20 million visitors landing on the page within one minute.
Former CIA agent and whistleblower Edward Snowden took to Twitter to criticize the cryptocurrency trading platform for spending $16 million on a Super Bowl ad while spending zero to ensure the website didn’t crash. It is unclear how Snowden would know whether Coinbase spent money to attempt to ensure the functionality of its website following the ad airing.

"What The Fed's Balance Sheet Reduction Will Mean For The S&P 500 The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) is off to a shaky start to 2022, down 5.1% year-to-date.
Investors are rightfully concerned about the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate hikes starting as soon as March, but history suggests the Fed's plan to begin reducing its balance sheet could be even more of a bearish catalyst for stock prices than rising rates.
Balance Sheet Expansion: The Federal Reserve's balance sheet roughly doubled in size to an unprecedented $9 trillion during the pandemic thanks to aggressive monthly bond and mortgage-backed security purchases. That buying has contributed to elevated inflation levels and high stock market valuations.
The Fed has hinted it will begin its ""quantitative tightening"" process in the near future, but the last time the Federal Reserve sold assets, it didn't go well for stock market investors.

"What Happens When The Yield Curve Flattens And Potentially Inverts? Here's What To Watch And How To Trade It The yield curve is simply the spread between long-term and short-term interest rates. Short-term rates tend to be more influenced by central banks and monetary policy to stimulate the economy, support employment and maintain price stability. Long-term rates are typically impacted by underlying supply and demand forces.
Yield Curve Explained: Under normal conditions, interest rates on longer-term debt are higher than rates on shorter-term debt. This phenomenon makes sense because there is an opportunity cost when investors tie up their money in bonds for 10 or 20 years instead of one or two years.

Investors often use the spread between 10-year U.S. Treasury yields and 2-year U.S. Treasury yields as a gauge of future growth or potential economic downturns. When the difference between the 10-year and 2-year yield is large, the yield curve is considered ""steep."" A steep yield curve suggests future economic growth.

Furthermore, they are prohibited from entering into derivatives contracts and engaging in short sales or purchasing securities on margin.

"What To Watch On Ford's Chart After The Automaker Files For A Tesla-Like Feature Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) stock spiked 5% when the markets opened on Friday, following a report the legacy-turning-electric vehicle manufacturer had filed a patent for a feature called Pet Mode that keeps the air-conditioning on, plays music and can open and close the sunroof for animals inside the vehicle when the owners are away.
The feature, which will likely be available in Ford’s upcoming EV line up, will launch the company further into direct-competitor status with Tesla, which has a similar feature called Dog Mode.
At 10:30 a.m. EST, a report stated Ford CEO Jim Farley is mulling ways to operate the company's electric vehicle business separately, causing a bearish reaction on the stock and Ford fell almost 3% lower over the 1 1/2 hours that followed before recovering slightly.

"10 Weirdest Presidential Facts Of All Time Presidents' Day falls on Feb. 21 this year, and this offers an opportunity to consider the achievements of the nation's finest leaders. However, each president had his own challenges, quirks and anomalies, and in celebration of the off-kilter we are happy to share our picks for the 10 weirdest presidential facts of all time.
The Presidents Before Washington: George Washington was inaugurated as the first U.S. president in 1789. However, the nation declared its independence in 1776 – so, who was running the country during those intervening 13 years?
John Hancock was serving as President of the Continental Congress for the United Colonies of America when the Declaration of Independence was signed, at which point he became President of the Continental Congress for the United States of America. Henry Laurens, John Jay and Samuel Hamilton succeeded him in that position. With the passage of the Articles of Confederation on March 1, 1781, Hamilton became President of the United States in Congress Assembled, and over the next several years the position was held by Thomas McKean, John Hanson, Elias Boudinot, Thomas Mifflin, Richard Henry Lee, John Hancock, Nathaniel Gorham, Arthur St. Clair and Cyrus Griffin all served as President of the United States in Congress Assembled.
With the 1789 ratification of the Constitution, the federal government was established and Washington was elected as its president.

The Gospel According To Jefferson: While everyone knows Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, many people are unaware that he rewrote the New Testament.
Jefferson combined passages of the four Gospels by cutting pages out of his personal Bibles with a razor and gluing pages together. In this process, he edited out all of Jesus’ miracles, passages that advocated for his divinity and the Resurrection. He compiled the work under the title “The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth” but would not allow its publication during his lifetime.
Now commonly called the Jefferson Bible, this distinctive consideration of the sacred text was not known to the general public until the Smithsonian Institution acquired the copy from Jefferson’s great-great-granddaughter in 1895. It was finally published until 1904.

John Tyler’s Postal Policies: In 1841, President William Henry Harrison died one month after his inauguration, making him the first president to die in office. This created a constitutional dilemma on Vice President John Tyler’s ability to succeed Harrison.
To Tyler, there was no question that the Constitution spelled out the chain of succession, and he took the presidential oath. To Tyler’s detractors, however, the Constitution was not clear on whether a vice president automatically assumed the full presidential authority.
Throughout his administration, Tyler’s foes refused to acknowledge him as the legitimate president and would send correspondence to the White House addressed to “Acting President John ...",2022-02-19T20:40:06Z,https://www.benzinga.com/government/22/02/25679002/10-weirdest-presidential-facts-of-all-time,0

"Analysis: Are US Sanctions Against Putin Too Weak? Or Does Biden Have A Secret Cyber Plan In Waiting? U.S. President Joe Biden offered a second round of economic sanctions on Russia aimed primarily at the nation’s banking industry. But the president acknowledged his first round of sanctions unveiled Wednesday and his repeated threats to enact financial hardship on Russia have yet to make an impact on President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.
However, a news report has surfaced that the Biden administration might be taking a proactive approach to dealing with the Putin regime rather than a reactive strategy via a cybersecurity assault that would disrupt the Russian presence in Ukraine.

What Happened: Speaking from the East Room of the White House, Biden expanded the U.S. sanctions to include five Russian banks — Novikom, Otkritie, Sberbank, Sovcom and VTB — that hold a combined $1 billion in assets. Biden also expanded sanctions against 10 Russian nationals, including financial services executives and those with close ties to Putin.
“Putin is the aggressor,” Biden said. “Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage.”

The Ukraine caucus on Capitol Hill encouraged members to wear blue and yellow ribbons for the President’s speech on Tuesday night. Some members could be seen in blue and yellow suits, ties and dresses.
The Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi introduced the President before the commencement of his address to the Congress. It was the first time in history that two women were seated behind the President. 
Russia-Ukraine Crisis: “Freedom will always triumph over tyranny,” said Biden. “Six days ago, Russia's Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.”

“Strong balance sheets bolstered REITs’ resilience during the pandemic and leave them well-positioned for the likely higher interest rate environment ahead,” said John Worth, Nareit’s executive vice president for research and investor outreach.

"How Does The Inflation And Oil Shock Of 2022 Compare To The Late 1970s? The Labor Department recently reported a 7.5% increase in the consumer price index in the month of January, the fastest inflation growth since 1982.
While inflation rates at 40-year highs may seem scary at first glance, economists say today's economic situation is far different than the period of hyperinflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Deja Vu? It's understandable why the recent climate of soaring commodity prices, skyrocketing money supply and massive government spending initiatives are drawing comparisons to the 1970s.
Government stimulus payments boosted consumer demand during the pandemic. Throughout 2020 and 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve chose to let inflation rise, in part because the Fed believed it had focused too much on inflation since the 2008 financial crisis. That decision likely suppressed job and wage growth for Americans.

"Analysis: Has The Failed Fed Nomination Of Sarah Bloom Raskin Made 'Climate Change' A Political Dirty Word? Sarah Bloom Raskin’s decision to withdraw from being President Joe Biden’s nominee as the Federal Reserve’s vice chairperson of banking supervision has been attributed to her advocacy of using the central bank’s regulatory powers to enforce climate risks within financial institutions.
Raskin was formerly a member of the Fed's Board of Governors and was a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in the Obama administration, but the nomination set a precedent because the focus of her candidacy was aimed at her political philosophy regarding the role of financial regulators.
By failing to secure majority support in the Senate — all 50 Republicans plus West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin opposed her nomination — Raskin’s doomed candidacy might encourage a new consideration of whether the advocacy of climate change solutions is a politically expedient idea.
The Raskin View: Last September, Raskin published an opinion piece in Project Syndicate that questioned why the U.S. couldn't follow the example in other countries of incorporating climate change concerns into their financial regulatory activities.
“While none of its regulatory agencies was specifically designed to mitigate the risks of climate-related events, each has a mandate broad enough to encompass these risks within the scope of the instruments already given to it by Congress,” she wrote. “Accordingly, all U.S. regulators can — and should — be looking at their existing powers and considering how they might be brought to bear on efforts to mitigate climate risk.”
Raskin argued financial regulators should “be encouraged to think more imaginatively about how they can engage with local transition efforts. For example, how might financial policies from diverse agencies be stitched together to produce outcomes that enable firms to hit their net-zero targets? How can financial policy be used to help accelerate a transition that redeploys workers for new jobs, or to assist households that are being asked to change their spending habits? And how can regulatory changes relating to disclosure, access to credit, and pricing of risk support a rapid and just green transition?”
According to a Politico report, Raskin was unapologetic about her views when she alerted President Biden of her decision not to continue with her nomination.
“Their point of contention was my frank public discussion of climate change and the economic costs associated with it,” she wrote in a letter to Biden. “It was ...",2022-03-17T16:25:04Z,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/esg/22/03/26170940/analysis-has-the-failed-fed-nomination-of-sarah-bloom-raskin-made-climate-change-a-political-dirty-w,0
"How The Fed's Rate Increase Will Affect You The latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes released this week suggest the potential for seven interest rate hikes in 2022. 
Wall Street and economics gurus love to make a fuss over the timing and potential implications of interest rate changes, but not every American is a bond trader, an economics professor or a monetary policy connoisseur.
Much Ado About Nothing? From a practical standpoint, a 0.25% interest rate hike means very little for the average middle-class “Main Street” American.

Interest rates do have an impact on the average American, but it’s part of the Federal Reserve’s goal to raise rates so slowly and slightly that each individual hike doesn’t rattle the cage, so to speak.

"You Ask, We Analyze: Is There More Upside Ahead For The SPDR S&P 500, Or Will It Be Dragged By Death Cross? On Thursday evening, Benzinga asked its followers on Twitter what they’re buying at the open on Friday. Benzinga selected one ticker from the replies for technical analysis.
@RichardJudge17 and @Surfer1Cal are buying the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY).
The SPY has been volatile so far this year, whipsawing over 1.5% on many days and over 4% on some days, compared to the less than 1% swings that were common in 2021.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the lead up to the Federal Reserve’s monthly meeting in March weighed heavily on investors, with the SPY falling almost 15% between the Jan. 4 all-time high of $479.98 and the low of $415.79 printed on March 14.
On Wednesday, the Fed raised its target rate hike to between .25bps and .5bps and projected it could raise interest rates five more times in 2022. The market reacted bullishly to the news, and the SPY closed that trading day up 2.22% and rallied an additional 1.25% higher on Thursday.

"The Stock Market Is Looking Bullish, But When Is The Right Time To Buy? Establishing a bullish or bearish bias or an edge to an asset or a market is the foundation of sound investing. A lack of an edge is often where budding investors go wrong, making their decision more in line with gambling. 
There is an expression that states that if you cannot define your edge, you do not have one. And if you do not have an edge, you will get eaten by someone who does.
Several ways to define an edge exist, with technical analysis being the simplest. Using charts to establish high-probability assets is a proven approach that goes back decades to the dawn of the financial markets used by some of the finest traders and investors. 
One of the first indicators that you will find on a successful investor's charts is the 200sma. Depending on their holding period, this will appear on either the weekly or the daily timeframe. 
If the price was trading above the 200sma, the bias was bullish, and traders looked for long opportunities. 
If the price was trading below the 200sma, the bias was bearish, and traders looked for shorting opportunities. 
They did not go against the bias. Institutions still use that logic today, as do trend followers like me with a holding period of 18 to 24 months.

What Is An Inverted Yield Curve? The yield curve is a plot of the yields of bonds with equal credit quality but different maturity dates. For U.S. investors, the most commonly referenced yield curve is a plot of 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields, which have yet to invert at this point.
A typical yield curve includes much higher interest rates for maturities further into the future. In a flat yield curve, there's little difference between short-term yields and long-term yields.
